// One ROM's LED engine.
//
// Owns both of One ROM's LEDs: the discrete status LED, driven from SIO, and
// the RGB LED, driven by a PIO state machine.  A caller sets a mode and the
// engine keeps it going, so nothing has to tick an LED from its own loop.
//
// The RGB LED's state machine is claimed on the first request that needs it.
// Until then the GPIO is left exactly as boot configured it, so a device
// nothing has asked about drives nothing and takes no interrupts.

// What a request can leave unsaid, and the floors it cannot go below, are in
// the metadata schema: LED_*_DEFAULT_*, LED_*_MIN_PERIOD_MS, LED_*_STEPS,
// LED_MIN_FRAME_MS and LED_DEFAULT_*.  The host CLI states them in its help and
// refuses what this engine would, and the plugin API tester predicts this
// engine's answers from them.
//
// A beacon takes a default duration rather than a rule of its own because a
// beacon is a bounded identify, not a mode a device sits in, and a hold is
// exactly that bound.
//
// The frame interval is a mode's period over its steps, so a longer period is
// smoother rather than slower, and blink has two steps because it has two
// states.  Each mode's minimum period is what keeps that interval at or above
// LED_MIN_FRAME_MS: below it the engine would have to run frames closer
// together than that and could not do what was asked.  A shorter period is
// refused rather than quietly treated as the minimum, which would have the
// engine report back a period it was not running at.
//
// Flame divides its own flicker table instead.  The table plays over
// LED_FLAME_DEFAULT_PERIOD_MS, so a period of that length runs it at the speed
// it is written at and a shorter one hurries it, and its shortest entry is 10ms
// of 575 - so the 500 minimum leaves every entry whole.

// The engine's state is written from two places at once: a caller in thread
// context, and the frame interrupt.  Those can be on different cores - a user
// plugin on core 0 can drive the status LED while the system plugin's animation
// runs on core 1 - so masking interrupts is not enough on its own, and neither
// is LDREX/STREX, which spans cores only when the memory is marked shareable
// and this firmware configures no MPU.  See the same reasoning at
// SPINLOCK_ORA_LOG in plugin.c.
//
// The lock is SPINLOCK_LED, allocated with the others in reg-rp235x.h.

// How long after handing a pixel to the state machine the pin is given back, on
// a board where the two LEDs share it.  The bits take about 30us at this clock
// and the pixel latches on a low of at least 50us after them, so the colour is
// taken before the pin changes hands.  For the rest of a frame - 40ms at the
// slowest mode, and no frame at all once a colour is static - the pin is the
