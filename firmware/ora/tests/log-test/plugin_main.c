// Exercises One ROM's plugin logging API (ORA_ID_LOG_*).
//
// One source, flashed as both the system and the user plugin, so two instances
// run on different cores and contend for the same log channel.  Neither
// instance is told which role it plays: both attempt the write claim and take
// their role from the result, so either outcome of the race is a valid run.
//
// Flashed on its own it finds no second instance, runs the checks a single
// instance can run, and reports that the claim exclusion was not exercised.
//
// The verdict is a repeating count of status LED flashes, so no debug probe is
// needed to read it.  A one-line summary is also left unread in the log
// channel, for a probe attached after the run.  See README.md.

// budgets below are roughly 0.5s, 2s, 4s, 0.2s and 9s.  Clock dependent, and
// deliberately generous.
//
// Each budget is set against a different event, which is why they are not one
// number:
//
// - LT_ROUNDS_LONG covers waits within a run, which only have to outlast the
//   skew between the two cores starting - microseconds.
// - LT_ROUNDS_SEND covers taking the write claim to hand a verdict over.  The
//   other instance can hold that claim for the whole of its own run, so this
//   is measured against a run, not against a core start.
// - LT_ROUNDS_SETTLE is how long the collecting instance holds off writing its
//   summary after taking a frame, so that the sending instance is certain to
//   observe the channel empty and know its frame was taken.  It is also the
//   per-attempt wait on the sending side.
// - LT_ROUNDS_COLLECT is how long an instance waits for a frame.  It must
//   outlast the sending side, so that a slow sender is waited for rather than
//   reported missing.
//
//   Not the sender's whole elapsed time, which can exceed it: a sender can
//   spend LT_ROUNDS_SEND on its first attempt alone.  But it can only spend
//   that while the other instance holds the write claim, and the collector does
//   not start waiting until it has released that claim - so what has to fit
//   inside LT_ROUNDS_COLLECT is the sender's total from the claim coming free,
//   which is at most LT_SEND_ATTEMPTS attempts of (claim + taken + refill).
