 *
 * Reports how the device treats the current ROM's addresses: the number of
 * low-order logical address bits not present on the lines the address monitor
 * observes, written to *bits_out. This is the bit difference between
 * @ref ora_demangle_addr_fn_t (logical byte address) and
 * @ref ora_demangle_observed_addr_fn_t (observed bus address) for this ROM. The
 * host's signalling stride is 1 << that value.
 *
 * The value is fixed by the One ROM variant:
 *
 *   - 0 on the 24-, 28- and 32-pin variants: every address line is observed;
 *     stride 1; the least-significant address line carries command data.
 *   - 1 on the 40-pin variant: the least-significant line is served through a
 *     separately-read pin the monitor does not sample; stride 2; that line
 *     carries no command data. This holds for every ROM on the variant — the
 *     ×16 parts (27C400/27C200) and 8-bit 40-pin parts alike.
 *
 * A plugin can combine this with the ROM byte size
 * (@ref ora_get_chip_size_from_type_fn_t) to bound host-supplied address pages:
 * the observed address span is (byte size >> the returned value).
 *
 * This is device-side information for the plugin's own use. The addressing
 * behaviour cannot be discovered over the wire at session time — a host must
 * already know it to frame the initiating knock — so it is never reported to
 * the host; a host obtains it from the plugin's documentation, agreed in
 * advance.
