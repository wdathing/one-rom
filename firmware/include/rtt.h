// One ROM RTT
//
// A One ROM implementation of real time transfer logging, binary compatible
// with SEGGER RTT.  probe-rs, OpenOCD, pyOCD and Black Magic Probe find and
// drain the log with no host side change and no plugin.
//
// Binary compatibility means three things, and only these three:
//
// - the control block and channel descriptor layouts, pinned by the static
//   asserts at the end of this header;
// - the symbol name _SEGGER_RTT, which is how a probe resolves the control
//   block when it looks it up rather than scanning for it;
// - the "SEGGER RTT" identifier string a probe scans memory for.
//
// Everything else - functions, types, constants - is One ROM's.
//
// SEGGER's copyright notice is retained in ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md at the repo
// root.  Their sources are no longer part of the build.

// Binary compatibility with SEGGER RTT, enforced rather than asserted in a

// Layout, from SEGGER_RTT.h: 16 byte id, two ints, then 24 byte descriptors,
// up buffers before down.  SEGGER's two descriptor structs share this layout,
// so one struct covers both.
//
// The layout is a property of the 32 bit target, where the two pointers in a
// descriptor are four bytes each.  A 64 bit host - firmware/test/rtt/ compiles
// this header natively - cannot satisfy it and is not asked to; the firmware
// build is what enforces it, and that is the build that has to be right.
