## [0.1.4] - 2026-09-17

This release adds a second pipe, carrying bytes in to One ROM from a far-end.
Pipe 1 is used by a USB terminal to send bytes to the USB plugin over the CDC
OUT endpoint. `PIPE_READ` returns the bytes sent this way. This feature
requires firmware 0.7.3. If using older firmware, continues to report a single
pipe.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-09-08

An ENTER_CMD_RESP naming a back-channel start within 8 bytes of the end of the
RAM slot wrote its response header onto the start of the image being served.
Such a start is now discarded in silence, as the specification requires, and
nothing is written.

ENTER_CMD_RESP cleared the whole response header on entry, so the token passed
through zero — which a host reads as its command having arrived.  Only the
reserved pair is written now, after the response field and before complete.

ENTER_CMD_RESP took the command page's range from the RAM slot, which a banked
slot makes larger than the image served, so it accepted a page no host could
drive.  The range is now the served ROM's, and a page past it is discarded.

A host can now set One ROM's LEDs over the ROM bus, through RBCP's new LEDs
group — so a bootloader can show a colour as it hands the machine over to the
image it loaded, and the colour stays after the session ends.

- LEDs are numbered contiguously over the ones the board has, so LED 0 is the
  status LED on a board with one and the RGB LED on a board with only that.  A
  host reads the type rather than assuming a number.
- The status LED reports its colour as red, which the plugin states: the
  firmware holds no record of what colour a monochrome LED is, and all-zero is
  RBCP's way of saying the colour is unknown.
- Flame is RBCP mode `0x80`, this implementation's own value from the range the
  protocol reserves for that.  The supported-modes bitmap reports `0x00` to
  `0x07` only, so flame does not appear in it.
- `SET_LED` does not block for its hold.  The firmware times it and restores
  what the LED was doing, which may be after the session has ended.
- Periods and holds are in RBCP's 100ms units, up to 25.5 seconds.  The firmware
  has a minimum period per mode and refuses a shorter one, which
  `GET_LED_MODE_INFO` reports so a host can name a period that will work.
- Needs firmware v0.7.2.  On v0.7.1 the device reports no LEDs and every other
  command in the group fails.

A host can now drive and read One ROM's own pins over the ROM bus, through
RBCP's new Auxiliary I/O group — so a wire from a One ROM pad can reach a reset
line, a drive, a relay or an indicator, and the retro system can operate it.

- `GET_PIPE_INFO` reports the two fields RBCP has added to it: the bytes waiting
  to be read, always zero on a pipe carrying only the OUT direction, and what
  kind of thing the pipe reaches, which One ROM reports as unspecified.
- Three pin groups: the GPIOs of the running RP2350 variant, the image select
  pads, and the X expansion pads.  The last two are RBCP group types `0x80` and
  `0x81`, this implementation's own values from the range the protocol reserves
  for that.  See the README for how a host should read them.
- A pin is drivable only where One ROM is using none of it, which depends on the
  active slot.
- A timed hold does not complete until the pin has reached its final state, and
  RBCP is unresponsive for its duration.
- Timed holds and the image select and X groups need firmware v0.7.2.  On
  v0.7.1 the device reports a `max_hold` of zero, which the specification
  defines as offering no timed holds, and exposes the GPIO group alone.

A host can now send bytes out through One ROM, over RBCP's new Pipes group, and
read them on a PC — so a retro system can get its output off the machine without
a serial port or a display.

- A pipe is One ROM's log channel, so the device's own logging is interleaved
  with the host's bytes, and two cores writing it at once corrupt rather than
  merely interleave. 
- Pipes need firmware v0.7.2 or later, where the logging API arrived.  On older
  firmware the device reports no pipes and nothing else changes, so the plugin
  still runs on v0.7.1.
- Implements RBCP 0.1.2, which also specifies what a device does with a command
  group or command it does not know.

A host can also put back the bytes the back-channel displaces in the image it is
being served, which nothing could do before — the region is a hole punched in a
running ROM, and every write a host made was followed by that command's own
response header.

- LOAD_AND_EXIT reloads a RAM slot from flash and leaves command-response mode
  without touching the header, which restores the whole image where the slot
  named is the one being served.
- EXIT_CMD_RESP_RESTORE takes up to eight bytes from the host and writes them
  over the start of the region on the way out, for an image with no flash source
  or a patch worth keeping.
- GET_BOOT_SLOT_INFO reports the flash slot One ROM booted and the RAM slot it
  went into, which is what a host needs to name in LOAD_AND_EXIT.  It needs
  firmware v0.7.2 or later, where the boot slot became readable through the
  metadata API.  On older firmware both are reported as unknown.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-09

Report as many RAM slots as the RAM holds, rather than at most seven, and keep
those a host cannot name for the plugin's own use.

- **Potentially breaking.**  A RAM slot is exactly one ROM region, so with a
  small ROM there are now far more slots and each is far smaller than before —
  as little as 2KB for a 2316, where the old cap of seven was meant to keep a
  slot at 64KB but could not, since a slot has to be the size of the ROM being
  served.  A host that assumed a slot was large enough for some purpose of its
  own, or that there were at most seven, sees something different.
- `GET_RAM_SLOT_INFO_ALL` now reports at most 170 slots however many the
  firmware has, because every command that names a slot rejects 0xAA and a slot
  no host can name is no use to one.  Slots above that are the plugin's.

Make NV storage writable on devices whose RAM slots are too small to stage a
transaction in.  Where the plugin has slots of its own it stages there, using as
many consecutive slots as the staging buffer needs, and leaves the slot the host
named untouched.

- Previously `GET_NV_CAPABILITY` reported NV storage writable whenever the
  device had more than one RAM slot, but every `NV_POKE_BEGIN` then failed if no
  single slot could hold the 4KB staging buffer and the erase routine — which is
  every device serving a ROM smaller than that.

Route RBCP command decode through the observed (bus) address space, so command
signalling works on a 40-pin part whose least-significant address line the
device does not observe.

Stop `RBCP_RESET`, `EXIT_CMD_RESP_SILENT` and `SWITCH_AND_EXIT` writing to the
response header.  All three ran the first half of the command processing
sequence before being recognised as silent, leaving the token incremented and
progress stuck at pending.

- **Behaviour change**, bringing the plugin into line with the specification,
  which requires all three to update nothing.  A host that polled after one of
  them would previously have waited for a completion that never came.

Stop `GET_FLASH_SLOT_INFO_ALL` overwriting the truncated record's `rom_type`
when that byte is the only one present.  The null terminator is now written
only where the record carries a name.

- **Potentially breaking.**  RBCP v0.1.1 clarifies that a truncated record's
  final byte is 0x00 where a name is present — previously unspecified, and
  what the plugin already did.  A host that relied on that byte being the
  record's real byte, or on a one-byte record being terminated, sees different
  data.

Stop acting on Group 0x01 Read commands received in command mode, where the
specification makes them valid in command-response mode only.  Previously such
a command executed and wrote its answer into a back-channel region the device
had already stopped maintaining, modifying the served ROM image outside any
session.  Group 0x01 and Group 0x03 now consume the command's argument bytes
and discard it.

- **Potentially breaking** for a host that issued a Read command in command
  mode and used the result — behaviour the specification never permitted.
  Neither the RBCP 6502 reference host nor r107sl's C64 bootloader does: both
  issue every Read and NV command through the command-response polling path.

Report failure, rather than discarding silently, when `ENTER_CMD_RESP` asks for
a back-channel larger than the RAM slot.  The specification requires failure
here and silent discard for the other malformed-argument cases, and a host
tells the two apart by whether the token increments.

Versions before 0.1.2 predate this file.
