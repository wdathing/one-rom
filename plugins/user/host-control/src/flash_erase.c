// MUST be compiled with -fPIC -fno-plt.  The function is copied into a RAM
// slot at runtime and called via function pointer, so that it can execute
// while XIP is disabled during the erase and program sequence.
//
// Self-contained by design: no globals, no static data, no external calls
// beyond those passed as parameters.  Verify with objdump that no absolute
// addresses appear in the output.

// RP2350 flash geometry
#define FLASH_BLOCK_SIZE      (65536u) // 64KB — largest erase granularity
#define FLASH_BLOCK_ERASE_CMD (0xD8u)  // SPI block erase command

// The erase and the program both run between the one exit from XIP and the one
// restore of it.  The bootrom's program function needs the flash in serial
// command mode exactly as the erase does, so a program issued after XIP came
// back is issued into a flash that is no longer listening for commands.
//
// The sequence must not be interrupted while flash is unreadable, because
// every handler this core would run lives there.  A host build has no
// cpsid/cpsie, so the masking goes to the harness instead of compiling away —
// see flash_irq_disable().  Everything else — the call order, the erase
// granularity, the command byte, the divisor handed back to the XIP restore —
// is the logic under test, and runs on a host unchanged.
