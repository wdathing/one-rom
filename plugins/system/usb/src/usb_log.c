// Forwarding One ROM's log to the CDC serial port, and the terminal's input
// back.
//
// The plugin claims the channels 0 and 1 for reading and writing respectively.
// When a terminal is attached the CDC interface.
// 
// Each terminal session opens with a banner naming the device.
//
// Nothing is forwarded until a terminal opens the port, so that a debug probe
// can still read the log on a device that merely has USB.  What has already
// accumulated is then forwarded rather than discarded - see log_drain_task().
//
// Two different conditions gate this, and they are not the same thing:
//
// - Whether a terminal has the port open, which is DTR, and which marks the
//   start of a session.  tinyusb reports the transition rather than the level,
//   so a close and reopen between two passes of the main loop is still seen as
//   both.
// - Whether the bus can carry data right now, which is tud_cdc_n_connected().
//   It also goes false on a bus suspend, where the terminal is still open, so a
//   host sleeping pauses the forwarding and resumes where it left off.

// above them and the one below them describe the same device by different
// routes.

// introducing itself, and when nothing is forwarded it is the end of the whole
