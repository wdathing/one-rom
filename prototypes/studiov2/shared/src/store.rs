//! The whole log: a file, plus an in-memory index of where each line starts.
//!
//! # Why a file and not a `Vec` of lines
//!
//! Three reasons, in order of weight.
//!
//! 1. **A copy across an arbitrary range is one read.** A user selecting from
//!    line 12 to line 900,000 wants those bytes, and the file holds them
//!    contiguously: one `read_at` of the byte range between the two positions.
//!    A `Vec<Arc<str>>` would have to walk and join 900,000 allocations.
//! 2. **Memory is the index alone.** Eight bytes a line, so a million lines
//!    cost 8 MB and the text sits in the page cache, which the kernel reclaims
//!    when it needs to.  A `Vec<Arc<str>>` of the same log costs about 112 MB
//!    that it never gives back: 16 bytes of fat pointer, 16 bytes of `Arc`
//!    header and the line itself, each in its own allocation.  A single
//!    `String` arena with the same offset index would cost about 88 MB, which
//!    is better but still every byte resident for the whole session.
//! 3. **It is what the CLI already does.** `onerom monitor log --output`
//!    writes a transcript, so a GUI whose log store *is* that transcript needs
//!    no second format and can be pointed at a file from a previous session.
//!
//! Searching gets the same benefit: [`Store::searcher`] hands out a second
//! file handle and a list of line-aligned byte ranges, and that handle scans
//! off the update thread while the log keeps growing.  Nothing is shared and
//! nothing is locked.
//!
//! # What is uncapped
//!
//! Everything.  A line written here is never dropped, and no method removes
//! one.  The bound on the process is the index, and the bound on the disk is
//! the disk.
