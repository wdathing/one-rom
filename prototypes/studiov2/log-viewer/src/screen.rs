//! The log and console screen.
//!
//! Two panes, both of which a hardware-management desktop app needs:
//!
//! * a **live log** that streams device output, sticks to the tail, lets the
//!   user scroll back, select with the mouse and copy — and keeps every line
//!   the device ever sent, for as long as the session lasts
//! * an **interactive console** — a device command shell, output plus a typed
//!   input line
//!
//! The log itself is not here.  It lives in [`Shared::log`], because the
//! builder writes to it too, and this screen holds a window of a few hundred
//! lines of it in a widget ([`crate::logview`]).  The earlier design, which
//! capped the widget's buffer and dropped the oldest lines, is still here
//! behind `--mode capped` so the two can be measured against each other.
