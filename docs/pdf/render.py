"""Render the One ROM documentation set to PDF.

The set, and every string that appears in a PDF but not in its source markdown,
is defined in docs.toml.  Nothing document-specific is written here.

Cover text comes from the document itself: the title is the markdown's leading
H1 and the subtitle is the paragraph that follows it.  Every One ROM document
already opens by naming itself and saying in a sentence what it covers, so a
second copy of that text kept alongside the build would only be a copy to let
drift.  The H1 is dropped from the body, since the cover now carries it.

A document assembled from several markdown files is the exception: no one member
names the whole, so its cover text is declared in docs.toml, and every member
keeps its own H1 as a top-level heading.  This renders one file either way -
the assembling is done before this runs, by
`cargo run -p doc-gen --bin doc-assemble`, which writes <slug>.md into the same
output directory.  ci/build-docs.sh runs the two in order.  Neither calls the
other.

A manifest of what was built is written to the output directory, for
ci/build-docs.sh to stage from.
