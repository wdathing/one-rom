# Logging

One ROM logs what it is doing, and there are two ways to read it: over USB to a serial terminal, which needs nothing but a cable, and over the SWD interface using RTT, which needs a debug probe.

Boot logging is always built in.  Extra debug logging is off by default, and is enabled by building from the repo root with:

```bash
DEBUG_LOGGING=1 make
```

## Over USB

One ROM's system USB plugin sends the log to its CDC serial port.  Attach a terminal — `onerom monitor log`, or `screen`, `minicom` or any other — and the log appears there.  This needs the USB plugin, firmware v0.7.2 or later, and a device that is running.  It does not need a debug probe.

**One ROM sends nothing until a terminal opens the port.**  That is deliberate: it leaves the log readable by a debug probe on a device that merely happens to have USB.  Until then the log accumulates exactly as it would on a device with nothing attached at all.

**What built up before you attached is sent too, not thrown away.**  The log buffer drops the newest record when it is full rather than evicting the oldest, so what is waiting when you connect is the earliest output since anything last drained it.  On a device nothing has been listening to, that is its boot log.

**What you type goes to the device.**  Terminal input goes to log channel 1, for a plugin to read.  `onerom console` sends as well as displays.  Needs firmware v0.7.3 or later.  If nothing on the device reads channel 1 it fills, and the terminal is held off.  No data is lost.

**A debug probe and a terminal must not both read the log.**  Both advance the same read position, so with both attached the output splits arbitrarily between them and neither sees all of it.  Nothing detects this — both look like correct readers.

### The banner

Every time a terminal opens the port, One ROM writes a short block identifying itself before any log content:

```
----- One ROM USB log -----
One ROM fire-28-c v0.7.2
Serial: 2E4A671D1C92AE5C
Logging: boot, plugin-internal, error, plugin-application
---------------------------
```

The board and firmware version follow the device.  `Name:` is present only when an instance name is set, leaving `Serial:` alone when it is not.  `Logging:` lists the kinds of output that are switched on — see below.

The banner's rules are deliberately unlike the `-----` the boot log opens with, so that the block the port writes about itself is not read as part of the log that follows it.

Where One ROM cannot send its log at all, the block is followed by a line saying why:

```
!!! Firmware v0.7.2 or later needed for USB logging !!!
!!! USB logging unavailable - another plugin is already reading the log !!!
```

### What gets logged

A quiet terminal is usually correct.  Most of what One ROM can log is switched off in a released build, and the banner's `Logging:` line names what is on.

| Kind | What produces it | Switched on by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `boot` | One ROM's own boot messages | `onerom program --boot-logging true`, per device.  Suppressed by turbo boot |
| `debug` | One ROM's verbose messages | firmware built `DEBUG_LOGGING=1`, plus boot logging as above |
| `plugin-internal` | a plugin's log messages | firmware built `PLUGIN_LOGGING=1` |
| `plugin-debug` | a plugin's verbose messages | firmware built with both of the above |
| `error` | errors, from One ROM and from plugins | always |
| `plugin-application` | output a plugin sends itself, rather than a log message | always |

**Not all of it need come from One ROM.**  `plugin-application` covers whatever a plugin chooses to send, and the [host-control plugin](/plugins/user/host-control/README.md) sends what the retro system gives it: a host can write bytes over the ROM bus using RBCP's Pipes group, and they arrive here.  So text on this terminal may be output from the machine One ROM is fitted in — a C64 printing to it, or a diagnostic ROM reporting from an Amiga with no serial port — rather than anything One ROM has to say.

It shares the one channel with everything above so a host's bytes and One ROM's own logging arrive interleaved.

`PLUGIN_LOGGING` and `DEBUG_LOGGING` both default to off and are not set by release builds, so on a downloaded firmware only `error` and `plugin-application` are unconditional, and `boot` depends on how the device was programmed.  A plugin can ask which are live through the plugin API rather than guessing — see `ora_log_category_enabled` in [`api.h`](/firmware/ora/api.h).

## Boot logging

The examples in this section are representative of what is logged, but were captured from very old firmware.

This logs the boot process.  It stops when the device enters its main ROM serving loop, as with logging enabled the device cannot hit the required performance.

Boot logging costs around 1.5ms of One ROM's startup time, taking it to roughly 3ms total.  That is substantially below most retro systems' reset circuit timers, so One ROM boots and is ready to serve the configured ROM image well before it is required.

Sample boot logs from a startup of firmware built with [`c64-no-destestmax.mk`](/old-config/c64-no-destestmax.mk), are shown below:

Pulling out some highlights:

- The `Hardare info` section logs provide information about the One ROM hardware that this firmware image **was built for**.  This may not necessarily the hardware you are running the firmware on.
- The `Pin Configuration` section logs show the pin mapping used by the firmware, including:
  - The data pins (D[0-7])
  - The address pins (A[0-15])
  - The chip select (CS) pins for each ROM type
  - The image select pins (SEL0, SEL1, SEL2)
  - The status LED pin (if supported)
- The `ROM info` section logs show you how many ROM images are included in the firmare, and some details about them:
  - their file names (as seen by the build process)
  - the ROM type (`2364`, `2332`, `2316`)
  - the chip select line configuration:
    - `0` means active low
    - `1` means active high
    - `-` means not used for this ROM type
- The `Running ...` section logs show One ROM's main activities as it starts up, including:
  - Whether the VOS (voltage scaling) is set to scale 1 (only done on the F411 and only when `FREQ` is > 84Mhz).  While the F405 also required VOS set to scale 1 for high frequency operation, this is its power-on default.
  - What the PLL MNPQ values have been set to (to allow you to check they are as intended to achieve the target `FREQ`).
  - How many flash wait states have been configured (the STM32 required a different number of wait states based on the `FREQ`).
  - `ROM sel/index` shows you what value the image select jumpers were set to, and what index that corresponds to in the firmware.
  - The logs also show the filename of the active ROM image, and whether it has been preloaded to RAM (the default behaviour).
  - Finally, the last line shows that the main loop has started, and that logging has stopped.

## `DEBUG_LOGGING`

This logs extra debug information, on top of the boot logging above.  Its added verbosity can sometimes cause RTT to lose some logs - this is typically shown as blank logs.  However, the RTT buffer has been increased in size, so this should not be a problem in most cases.

It is disabled by default, and is enabled by setting the `DEBUG_LOGGING` configuration option to `1`.  This type of logging is useful for debugging One ROM itself.

Example debug logging:
