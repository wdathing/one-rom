//! One ROM RBCP Tester
//!
//! Runs the host-control plugin's own C source natively against the firmware
//! emulator, driving it over emulated ROM bus cycles as a real host would.
//! The plugin is neither reimplemented nor stubbed: this is the same source
//! that is cross-compiled for the device, linked against the same plugin API.
//!
//! # Suites
//!
//! Scenarios are grouped into suites, which answer different questions:
//!
//! - `conformance` — does the device obey the RBCP specification?  One group
//!   of scenarios per specification section, each asserting what the spec
//!   requires rather than what this implementation happens to do.
//! - `integration` — does a realistic application work end to end?  Whole
//!   flows, modelled on the specification's worked example and the 6502
//!   reference host.
//!
//! Further suites are a table entry.
//!
//! # Environment variables
//!
//! | Variable     | Required | Description                                     |
//! |--------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------|
//! | `BOARD`      | yes      | Board name, e.g. `fire-24-a`                    |
//! | `CONFIG`     | yes      | Path to the firmware config JSON file           |
//! | `BASE_DIR`   | no       | Project root for resolving relative paths       |
//! | `ONEROM_LOG` | no       | Set to `1` to enable firmware logging to stdout |
//! | `RUST_LOG`   | no       | Tester log level (default: `warn`)              |
//!
//! # Arguments
//!
//! `--suite <name>` runs one suite; `--scenario <substr>` runs only scenarios
//! whose name contains the substring.  Both default to everything.
//!
//! A scenario that does not apply to the device under test — the RAM slot
//! count and slot size vary with the ROM type and the board — reports `SKIP`
//! with its reason rather than passing vacuously.
//!
//! Exits 0 if every scenario that ran passed, 1 otherwise.
