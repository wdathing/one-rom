//! An RBCP host, driving the device over emulated ROM bus cycles.
//!
//! Modelled on the 6502 reference host (`reference/host/6502/rbcp/rbcp.s` in
//! the rom-bus-control-protocol repository), because that is what a real host
//! does and therefore what the device must actually work against.
//!
//! # Everything is a ROM read
//!
//! A host has exactly one primitive: read a byte from the ROM.  Commands are
//! encoded as *where* it reads; responses are read back as ordinary ROM data.
//! So is every operation here, and all of them go through [`Bus::read`].
//!
//! Command data travels on the address lines the device observes.  Where the
//! device does not observe the ROM's lowest address line(s), the host advances
//! its read address by two (or more) per command byte — see "Address Line
//! Presentation" in the specification.  That is the only place the distinction
//! appears: [`Bus::command_addr`] shifts an observed address into the byte
//! address space the host actually drives, and everything else works in byte
//! addresses exactly as the host does.
//!
//! # Reads are not free
//!
//! Every read the host performs — including polling the back-channel — is a
//! CS-active bus cycle, so it lands in the device's capture ring alongside
//! command bytes.  In command-response mode the device is required to discard
//! the ones whose upper address bits do not match the configured command page.
//! Reading the back-channel over the bus rather than out of emulated memory is
//! what puts that filter under test; it is also simply what a host does.
//!
//! The device only drains that ring when it runs, and here it runs only when
//! the driver lets it, so each read hands the plugin a turn.  A scenario that
//! wants to overrun the ring can withhold those turns with
//! [`Bus::read_without_resuming`].
