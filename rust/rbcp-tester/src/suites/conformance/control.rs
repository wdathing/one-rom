//! Specification: "Group 0x00 — Control".
//!
//! Two of this group's commands exit command-response mode *silently*:
//! EXIT_CMD_RESP_SILENT "exits command-response mode without updating the
//! response header", and SWITCH_AND_EXIT "switches to the specified slot and
//! exits command-response mode without updating the response header".
//!
//! Both are asserted the same way, and the same way as RBCP_RESET in
//! [`super::reset`]: a NOP first, so the last command field holds a value the
//! scenario chose rather than whatever the image happened to contain; then the
//! exit; then a verified command-mode poke as a fence, proving the device has
//! processed the exit and is taking sessions again; and only then the header
//! read.  Without the fence the read would prove nothing, since a header not
//! yet written and a header never written look identical.
//!
//! # ENTER_CMD_RESP's two kinds of refusal
//!
//! The rest of the group turns on ENTER_CMD_RESP, whose entry the
//! specification refuses in two distinct ways, and the distinction is the
//! point: four malformed arguments make "the device silently discard the
//! command", while an oversized back-channel and a re-entry both make it
//! "return failure".  A host tells them apart by the token: a discarded
//! command never increments it, a failed one does and then reports failure in
//! the response field.
//!
//! Discard is an absence, so [`expect_entry_discarded`] does not merely look
//! for one.  It arms the byte the token *would* land on with a value of its
//! own choosing, written by a verified command-mode poke; sends the malformed
//! entry; fences with a second verified poke, so the device has demonstrably
//! processed a command after the stimulus; and only then reads the byte, where
//! anything but the armed value means the device wrote there and an accepted
//! entry's increment says by how much.  It finishes by entering properly,
//! which proves the refusal was about the argument rather than a wedged device
//! or a frame the device never saw.  Where the malformed start puts that byte
//! past the ROM being served, the host cannot read it and the write log carries
//! the assertion alone.
//!
//! Exit is asserted through re-entry throughout, for the reason [`super::reset`]
//! gives: ENTER_CMD_RESP is defined to fail while the device is already in
//! command-response mode, so an entry that *succeeds* is positive proof the
//! device had left.
