//! Specification: "Group 0x02 — Modify".
//!
//! Four commands that change device state: SLOT_POKE writes one byte into a RAM
//! slot, SWITCH_SLOT activates one, LOAD_SLOT copies a flash image into one
//! "without activating the slot", and SLOT_POKE_ALL_BYTE fills one.  Each names
//! a slot in its final argument, and each "is invalid and rejected" when that
//! argument is 0xAA — the value reserved so that a reset started mid-command is
//! always detectable.  The group is "valid in both command and command-response
//! modes", so SLOT_POKE and SWITCH_SLOT are exercised in each.
//!
//! # How a change of state is observed
//!
//! Three of these commands act on a slot that is *not* being served, so their
//! effect cannot be read as ROM data.  The host's way in is SLOT_PEEK, which
//! "read\[s\] one or more bytes from the specified RAM slot" into the
//! back-channel: a device-side read of the target slot, answered over the bus.
//! Every such scenario therefore arranges three distinguishable values —
//!
//! - **the served slot's**, put there by a verified SLOT_POKE, so a peek that
//!   answered from the served slot instead of the one it named is caught;
//! - **the target slot's**, put there by a SLOT_POKE naming that slot, so a
//!   command that did nothing at all is caught;
//! - **the flash image's own**, read over the bus before anything is written
//!   over it, which is what LOAD_SLOT must produce —
//!
//! and no assertion rests on a byte simply not having changed.
//!
//! # A second RAM slot
//!
//! Most of this group is about a slot other than the one being served, and the
//! device may have only one: the RAM slot count falls out of the ROM table
//! size, and a 512 KB region leaves room for one.  Those scenarios skip there,
//! naming what the device lacks, rather than degenerating into a poke at the
//! active slot that would assert something weaker under the same name.
//!
//! # Addresses below the command page
//!
//! A read is how the host signals, so any read below the command page's first
//! address *is* a command byte.  The device's own reads are not, which makes
//! SLOT_PEEK the only way to inspect the bottom of a slot — and the fill
//! scenario needs it for exactly that.
