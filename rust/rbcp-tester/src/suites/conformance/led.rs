//! Specification: "Group 0x06 — LEDs".
//!
//! Four commands over the device's own LEDs: three that describe what it has and
//! what its modes need, and one that drives one.
//!
//! # LEDs are optional, and absence is a legitimate answer
//!
//! "A device that has no LEDs reports a count of zero from
//! GET_LED_CAPABILITY.  All other commands in this group return failure on such
//! a device."  So a zero count is conformant, and every scenario past
//! [`get_led_capability`] skips on it.  That one never skips, and is where the
//! "all other commands fail" rule is asserted.
//!
//! # What an LED is doing is read back through the protocol
//!
//! Unlike a pin, an LED has no second window onto it here: GET_LED_INFO is the
//! only way to see what SET_LED did.  That makes the round trip the assertion
//! throughout — set a mode, a colour, a period, then read them back — which is
//! also exactly what a host can see, so nothing is asserted that a host could
//! not itself rely on.
//!
//! # What a mode needs is the device's to say
//!
//! Which modes take a period, and the shortest period each accepts, are reported
//! per mode and per LED by GET_LED_MODE_INFO rather than fixed by the protocol.
//! So the scenarios here take the floor off the device and hold it to it —
//! [`set_led_honours_the_reported_floor`] requires the reported floor to be
//! accepted and the value below it refused, which is the whole of what makes
//! SET_LED's period predictable to a host.
//!
//! # A hold is the device's timer, not the device blocking
//!
//! "The device completes the command without waiting for the hold, which
//! outlives the command-response session."  That is the opposite of SET_AUX,
//! and [`set_led_hold_does_not_block`] holds it to both halves: the command
//! completes with the clock standing still, and moving the clock past the
//! deadline and running a frame puts the LED back.
//!
//! # What this suite does not verify
//!
//! 1. "An LED's state persists ... across RBCP_RESET.  Only a device reset
//!    restores an LED to its power-on state."  The reset half is asserted; the
//!    device reset half has no device reset in this harness.
//! 2. The shape of an animated mode — that a hue walks, that a breath fades.
//!    RBCP reports the mode in force and nothing finer, so the protocol cannot
//!    see it.  The firmware's own LED tests own that.
//! 3. A `count` above two.  This firmware has two LED channels, so the walk
//!    over them is exercised as far as a device can drive it.
//! 4. Type values 0x80-0xFE, and modes 0x06 and 0x07.  This device reports
//!    neither, so they are checked only as values the protocol allows.
