//! Specification: "Group 0x03 — NV Storage".
//!
//! Seven commands over a device's dedicated non-volatile storage: one that
//! reports the capability, one that reads, and five that make up a
//! transactional write — BEGIN loads NV storage into a RAM staging buffer,
//! POKE modifies bytes of it, and COMMIT or DISCARD resolves the transaction.
//! COMMIT_BYTE performs the whole of a single-byte transaction in one command.
//!
//! # How NV storage is observed
//!
//! NV storage is not served over the bus, so the host's only view of it is
//! NV_PEEK — a device-side read answered into the response data section.  A
//! host's only way to *write* it is a commit.
//!
//! That would leave every read scenario asserting the write command it is
//! trying to be independent of, so the harness seeds NV storage directly with
//! [`Bus::seed_nv`], standing in for what a previous boot's host left there.
//! Seeding is setup; every assertion is made through the device, over the bus.
//! The two are separate paths, so their agreement is a real statement.
//!
//! Every scenario starts with NV storage erased to 0xFF, which is what the
//! specification requires of a device no host has written to.
//!
//! # Writability
//!
//! "A RAM slot must be provided by the host for the device to use as a staging
//! area" and "if the device only supports a single RAM slot, it cannot perform
//! multiple write transactions and hence GET_NV_CAPABILITY reports any NV
//! storage as read-only."  That single sentence is the *only* thing the
//! specification says about the writable flag, so it is the only thing
//! [`get_nv_capability`] asserts about it.
//!
//! Everything else about writability is asserted as self-consistency instead.
//! How a device finds somewhere to stage a transaction is its own affair — it
//! may keep storage the host never sees, or it may need the slot the host names
//! to be big enough — and a suite that predicted which would be checking the
//! implementation against a copy of itself.  So
//! [`nv_capability_matches_behaviour`] holds the device to whatever it claims,
//! in both directions, and every other write scenario skips on that claim
//! knowing it has been pinned.
//!
//! # Asserting that a transaction is gone
//!
//! Several requirements are that a transaction was discarded, which is an
//! absence.  None of them is asserted by looking for one.  A discarded
//! transaction and a retained one are told apart positively, by what the device
//! does next: NV_POKE "fails if no write transaction is in progress" and
//! NV_POKE_BEGIN "fails if a write transaction is already in progress", so the
//! two commands answer in opposite directions and [`expect_no_transaction`]
//! requires both answers.  A device that merely wedged fails the second.
