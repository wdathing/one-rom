//! Specification: "Command Framing" and its "Command Mode Constraint".
//!
//! A frame is `[GROUP] [CMD] [A0..An]` with no length field: both ends know
//! the argument count from the GROUP+CMD pair.  The consequence, which this
//! module is really about, is what happens when a host stops short.  The
//! device goes on consuming address reads as arguments of the command already
//! in progress until that count is satisfied, and only then can a knock
//! re-establish framing.
//!
//! The specification bounds the damage: "a host recovering from desync in
//! command mode need transmit at most 10 additional address reads before a
//! knock can re-establish framing", the maximum argument count being 9.
//!
//! All three scenarios observe through SLOT_POKE, which is valid in command
//! mode — see [`crate::driver::Probe`] for why they are framed as
//! discriminations between two values rather than as "nothing changed".
