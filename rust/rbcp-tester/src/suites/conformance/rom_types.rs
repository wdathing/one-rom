//! Specification: "ROM Types".
//!
//! The protocol assigns one byte to each ROM type, and the device reports one
//! in GET_RAM_SLOT_INFO_ALL's `rom_type` field and in every GET_FLASH_SLOT_INFO
//! record.  "Note that the ROM type values above are defined by the protocol
//! independently of any specific device implementation."
//!
//! The table below is transcribed from the specification and from nothing else.
//! That is the whole value of this module: the device's numbering comes from
//! `onerom-config`'s chip type definitions, so a table taken from there — or
//! from the firmware, or from the plugin — would agree with the device by
//! construction and would assert nothing at all.  Two independently maintained
//! copies of a numbering can disagree; one copy compared with itself cannot.
//!
//! # Shape of these scenarios
//!
//! Which chip sits in which slot is fixed by the configuration under test, and
//! that is not in question here — it is the byte the device puts on the wire to
//! describe that chip which is.  So each scenario looks the chip's name up in
//! the protocol's table, asks the device over the bus, and requires the two to
//! agree.
//!
//! A value outside the table is reported the way the specification tells hosts
//! to read one — "Host implementations must handle reserved values gracefully,
//! as new ROM types may be defined in future protocol versions" — so it is
//! named as reserved, as not available, as implementation-specific, or as
//! "invalid / ROM not being served", rather than printed as an unexplained
//! number.  It is still a
//! failure when it appears here, because the chip being described is known and
//! the table defines a value for it.
//!
//! The converse case — a chip the protocol's table does not name — is not a
//! failure of the device, which "is not required to support all ROM types
//! listed" and to which the protocol offers 0x80–0xFE for its own use.  There
//! is then no normative value to check against, so the scenario skips and says
//! which chip left it with nothing to assert.
//!
//! These scenarios run against every configuration in the matrix, and each
//! configuration serves several chips, so between them the runs cover far more
//! of the table than any single run does.
