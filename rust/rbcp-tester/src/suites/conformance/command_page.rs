//! Specification: "Command Page".
//!
//! "During command-response mode, the device filters incoming address reads
//! using the command page configured in ENTER_CMD_RESP.  Only reads whose upper
//! address bits (above A7) match the command page value are treated as command
//! bytes."
//!
//! This is what lets a host read its own back-channel.  Those reads are on the
//! page the region lives on, and the host makes hundreds of them per command —
//! so a device that decoded them would be taking its own answers as commands.
//! The knock this scenario sends off the page lands inside the back-channel
//! region for that very reason: on this tester's layout the six knock bytes are
//! six ordinary reads of the region, which is the case the filter exists for.
//!
//! [`super::reset::off_page_reset_is_filtered`] covers the same filter for
//! RBCP_RESET, which needs no knock in front of it and so says nothing about
//! whether a knock is filtered.
//!
//! # Every other session in this tester runs at page zero
//!
//! [`crate::Ctx::command_page`] is zero, and every scenario outside this module
//! enters with it.  A device that ignored ENTER_CMD_RESP's A0/A1 altogether and
//! filtered on page zero would pass all of them, which is why
//! [`the_configured_page_is_the_one_filtered_on`] enters at a page of its own
//! and builds its own back-channel to do it.
//!
//! # What this suite does not verify
//!
//! 1. The filter outside command-response mode.  "Outside command-response
//!    mode, the command page has no effect", so there is no requirement to
//!    hold a device to.
//! 2. Pages beyond the two these scenarios name.  A device is held to filtering
//!    one wrong page in each direction rather than all of them.
//! 3. How wide the field is, exactly.  The configured page below is the highest
//!    the ROM allows, so it differs from zero in the top bit of the field as
//!    well as the bottom, but a device reading one bit more or fewer than the
//!    specification names is not distinguished from a conformant one by two
//!    pages alone.
