//! Specification: "Group 0x01 — Read", and the response format section of each
//! of its eight commands.
//!
//! The Read group is where the device describes itself, so almost every
//! scenario here is a field-by-field reading of a "… Response Format" table:
//! the data section begins at offset 8 within the back-channel region, and each
//! command lays out named bytes from there.  Reserved bytes must be zero, name
//! fields are ASCII and null-terminated with their unused bytes zeroed, and the
//! commands that take a slot argument must reject 0xAA in it.
//!
//! # Where the expected values come from
//!
//! Most fields are checked against something other than the device's own word
//! for them, because a response that merely agrees with itself asserts nothing:
//!
//! - the flash slot count against `ctx.config`, from which the firmware under
//!   test is built — its chip sets are the populated, non-plugin flash slots;
//! - GET_FLASH_SLOT_INFO_ALL's records against GET_FLASH_SLOT_INFO for the same
//!   slot, which the specification requires, since the former "provides the
//!   entirety of the information exposed by GET_FLASH_SLOT_COUNT and
//!   GET_FLASH_SLOT_INFO in a single request response";
//! - the RAM slot counts against what the device reports through its own plugin
//!   API at start-up, in [`crate::Ctx`];
//! - SLOT_PEEK's data against what the device *serves* at those same addresses.
//!   Serving and peeking are separate paths through the device, so agreement
//!   between them is a real assertion, and the bytes peeked are ones this module
//!   put there with a verified SLOT_POKE first.
//!
//! # Back-channel sizes
//!
//! Several requirements are about there being too little room in the response
//! data section, so those scenarios enter command-response mode with a
//! back-channel of their own size rather than [`Ctx::session`]'s — see
//! [`Bus::enter_sized`].
