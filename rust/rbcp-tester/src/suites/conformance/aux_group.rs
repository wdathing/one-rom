//! Specification: "Group 0x05 — Auxiliary I/O".
//!
//! Six commands over device pins that are not part of the ROM interface: three
//! that describe what the device exposes, and three that drive a pin — one
//! plain, one that exits the session, one that exits and switches slot as it
//! goes.
//!
//! # Auxiliary I/O is optional, and absence is a legitimate answer
//!
//! "A device that exposes no auxiliary pins reports a group count of zero from
//! GET_AUX_CAPABILITY.  All other commands in this group return failure on such
//! a device."  So a zero count is conformant, and every scenario past
//! [`get_aux_capability`] skips on it.  That one scenario never skips — a
//! device with no pins still has to answer the capability command — and it is
//! also where the "all other commands fail" rule is asserted, since that is the
//! only place a zero count is a thing to test rather than a thing to skip on.
//!
//! # What a pin does is read back through the firmware's test build
//!
//! There is no silicon here, so `ora_gpio_set`'s register writes are compiled
//! out.  What it does instead is record what it drove into the test build's pad
//! model, and `ora_gpio_query` reads that back — so a scenario can assert that a
//! pin was driven low, driven high or released, and the pin-state scenarios
//! below do.
//!
//! What that does not prove is the register writes themselves.  The pad model is
//! a second implementation of the same intent rather than a check on the shipped
//! one, so "the firmware set the register" remains a hardware test.
//!
//! The scenarios ask rather than assume: [`pin_state_is_observable`] drives a pin
//! both ways and looks for the reported state to differ, and stands down with
//! that as the reason where it does not.  That keeps them honest against a build
//! whose reporting is not live, which is what this suite faced before the pad
//! model existed.
//!
//! One part of a pin's condition is visible beside the protocol: what One ROM is
//! using the GPIO for, which `ora_gpio_query` answers for real.  That is what
//! [`one_rom_withholds_pins_it_is_serving_with`] holds the drivable flag to.
//!
//! Everything else is asserted throughout: which commands succeed and which are
//! refused, that a hold does not complete before its time, that the terminal
//! variants write no response header and do leave the session, and that a slot
//! switch happens.  Those are most of the group's contract, and all of the part
//! a host depends on to stay in step with the device.
//!
//! # What this suite does not verify
//!
//! Kept here because this is where it stays accurate.
//!
//! The first list is reachable today and simply not written.  The pad model puts
//! every one of these within a scenario's grasp, so each is work rather than a
//! limitation:
//!
//! 1. SET_AUX with a non-zero hold "holds that state for the requested
//!    duration" — that the state is held rather than merely set.  Only that the
//!    command does not complete early is asserted.
//! 2. The same command "then applies `after`" — that `after` reaches the pin.
//! 3. "A value of zero holds the state until a subsequent SET_AUX changes it" —
//!    the latch.  Only that such a command completes untimed is asserted.
//! 4. SET_AUX_AND_EXIT "as SET_AUX" — the pin half.  The no-header, hold and
//!    exit halves are asserted.
//! 5. SET_AUX_SWITCH_EXIT "sets the specified pin ... in the order given by
//!    flags" — the pin half, and with it the ordering, which is only visible
//!    through the pin.
//! 6. "Under set-first ordering the device does not apply `after` until the
//!    slot switch has completed.  The effective hold is therefore the greater
//!    of the requested hold and the time the switch takes."
//! 7. "If received, neither the pin is set nor the slot switched" (slot 0xAA),
//!    and the same clause for a reserved flags bit, and for a device exposing
//!    no pins — the pin half of each.  The slot half and the exit are asserted
//!    in all three.
//!
//! The rest are out of reach for other reasons, and a pad model does not help:
//!
//! 8. "Only a device reset restores a pin to its power-on state."  There is no
//!    device reset in this harness.
//! 9. "Driving it through one group is indistinguishable from driving it
//!    through another."
//! 10. "Where a pin appears in several groups, every group reports the same
//!     properties for it."  Lining a group's pins up with another group's would
//!     mean rebuilding the device's own group-to-pin mapping in the tester.
//! 11. Group type 0x00 (None).  This device never reports it, so it is checked
//!     only as a value the protocol allows.
//! 12. A `pin_count` of zero standing for 256 pins.  This device never reports
//!     it.  The helpers here decode it, but nothing exercises the decoding
//!     against a device.
//! 13. The rule making 0xAA an invalid *group* distinguishable from an absent
//!     one.  A device would have to expose 171 groups for the two to differ,
//!     and this one exposes three.
//! 14. A device declaring *fewer* argument bytes than a command carries.  The
//!     leftover byte sits in front of the next knock and the knock detector
//!     slides past it, so no host can see it — see
//!     [`argument_counts_are_consumed_exactly`].
//! 15. `GET_AUX_PIN_INFO` reporting a non-zero `level` or `driven` with flags
//!     bit 1 clear.  [`pin_info_reports_flags`] asserts the rule for every pin
//!     of every group, so this is verified as far as the device can be driven
//!     into it — no argument reaches a state where this device reports bit 1
//!     clear at all.
//!
//! # Holds are timed against a clock the scenario owns
//!
//! A hold is the device busy-waiting on its millisecond counter.  Under
//! emulation that counter moves only when a scenario moves it — see
//! [`Bus::set_clock_us`] — so [`set_aux_holds_before_completing`] can require
//! the command to be *incomplete* at one clock value and complete at the next,
//! which is the whole of what the specification says a hold is.
