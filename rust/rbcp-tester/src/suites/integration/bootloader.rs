//! The specification's "Example — C64 Kernal Bootloader", run end to end.
//!
//! The worked example is nine steps, of which the first two are the host
//! copying itself into RAM and have no device side.  The rest are here, in
//! order, and each is a step the 6502 reference host has a routine for:
//!
//! | Example step | Here | Reference host |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | — | reset the device first | `rbcp_reset` |
//! | 3 | ENTER_CMD_RESP | `rbcp_cmd_enter_cmd_resp` |
//! | 4 | poll token then progress | `rbcp_issue_cmd` |
//! | — | check the protocol version | `rbcp_check_protocol_version` |
//! | 5, 6 | GET_FLASH_SLOT_INFO_ALL, read the menu | `rbcp_cmd_get_flash_slot_info_all` |
//! | 7 | LOAD_SLOT then SWITCH_AND_EXIT | `rbcp_cmd_load_slot`, `rbcp_cmd_switch_and_exit` |
//! | 9 | jump through the reset vector of the newly loaded ROM | — |
//!
//! with SLOT_POKE between the load and the switch, which is the pattern
//! SLOT_POKE itself prescribes: "LOAD_SLOT the target image into an inactive
//! RAM slot, issue SLOT_POKE commands to patch any vectors in that inactive
//! slot, then issue SWITCH_AND_EXIT to make it active".
//!
//! # What makes this an integration scenario rather than a longer conformance one
//!
//! Every command here has its own conformance scenario, and this asserts none
//! of them again.  What it asserts is the *end state a bootloader lands in*,
//! checked the way step 9 checks it — by reading the ROM.  A device that obeyed
//! every individual rule but left the host serving the wrong slot, or serving
//! the right slot without the patch, or still writing into a back-channel the
//! host has stopped reading, passes the conformance suite and fails here.
//!
//! So the verdict is three bus reads after the switch, and nothing else:
//!
//! - the patched vector is what the bus serves, which is one assertion about
//!   two things — the switch happened, and the patch went with it;
//! - the device takes a fresh command-mode session, which is the fence: it has
//!   demonstrably processed a command *after* the exit;
//! - the progress byte still holds a value this scenario chose, rather than
//!   either of the two the device writes while it is maintaining a
//!   back-channel.
//!
//! # Distinguishable values
//!
//! Three bytes live at the vector address over the course of the flow: the one
//! the served slot is marked with, the one LOAD_SLOT copies in, and the patch.
//! They are chosen to differ from each other, so the final read discriminates
//! rather than merely matching — a switch that did not happen serves the first,
//! a patch that did not land serves the second.
//!
//! # A second RAM slot
//!
//! The pattern is defined in terms of a slot that is not being served, so a
//! device with one RAM slot cannot run it.  Whether it has one turns on the
//! size of the ROM table region rather than on the part: a region of 512 KB
//! leaves room for a single slot, which a 27C400 reaches on either 40-pin
//! board and a 27C200 reaches on fire-40-a but not on fire-40-b.
//! It skips there rather than degenerating into a patch of the active slot,
//! which is the thing the specification warns against.
