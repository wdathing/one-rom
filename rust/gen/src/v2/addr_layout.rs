//! Address-range layout derivation for One ROM v2 metadata generation.
//!
//! This covers point C from the design discussion: for a chip set, find
//! the smallest contiguous GPIO range (>= 16 bits / 64KB) that covers all
//! the address-line GPIOs for the chip(s) involved, plus X1/X2 for
//! Multi/Banked sets, *and* fits within a single PIO GPIO window (see
//! `gpio_window`). That range becomes `alg_addr`'s `gpio_base` /
//! `num_addr_pins` / `num_rom_table_bits` (the latter two being equal).
//!
//! For Multi/Banked sets, the resolved GPIOs for X1/X2 *within this
//! range* are also recorded (`x1_gpio`/`x2_gpio`). Note these may differ
//! from X1/X2's GPIOs as resolved by `cs_data_layout` (Multi only): a
//! dual-bonded X pin can legitimately appear at different GPIOs in the
//! address-range PIO vs the CS/data-range PIO.
//!
//! X1 is included for any Multi/Banked set (always >= 2 chips). X2 is
//! only included for sets with >= 3 chips (4-bank Banked, or Multi with 3+
//! chips) - mirroring `cs_data_layout`'s `chip_types.len() >= 3` condition
//! for X2. For a 2-chip set, `x2_gpio` is `None`: including X2 in the
//! range unconditionally would (a) waste a table-index bit that
//! `build_rom_image` never reads for 2-bank sets, inflating
//! `num_addr_pins`/the ROM table size beyond what's needed, and (b)
//! require an X2 GPIO mapping on boards that don't have/need one for a
//! 2-chip set.
//!
//! `bit_mode` (the *effective* bit mode for chip0 - from
//! `alg_config::bit_mode_for`, accounting for any `force_16_bit`/future
//! `force_8_bit` override, computed once by the caller and shared with
//! `build_alg_config`) determines whether `chip0.address_pins()[0]` is
//! included as an address-PIO line:
//!
//! - `BitMode8`: included, as today - `num_addr_lines ==
//!   chip0.num_addr_lines()`, starting from `address_pins()[0]`.
//! - `BitMode16`: excluded. By convention, any chip with `bit_modes`
//!   including 16 has `address_pins()[0] == "A-1"` - the chip pin shared
//!   with its highest data line (e.g. 27C400/27C200's D15/A-1), used by
//!   `AlgData1`'s data-write PIO (`a_minus_1_pin`, derived separately from
//!   `cs_data_layout`) rather than the address-read PIO.
//!   `num_addr_lines == chip0.num_addr_lines() - 1`, starting from
//!   `address_pins()[1]`.
//!
//! ## Oversized ROMs
//!
//! For chips whose full address space exceeds `MAX_IMAGE_SIZE` (e.g.
//! 27C080 at 1MB), only the lower `max_useful_addr_lines` address lines
//! fit in the ROM table. The top `num_excess` address lines are carved off
//! into `AddrLayout::excess_addr_pin_gpios`: they don't contribute to
//! `num_addr_pins` or the address-PIO range, but their resolved GPIOs are
//! passed to `derive_cs_data_layout` to act as half-select CS pins, in
//! conjunction with the chip's CE/OE lines. The `cs1` configuration
//! (active_low/active_high) then determines which half of the ROM is
//! served. See `cs_data_layout` for the CS algorithm selection.
//!
//! `addr_pin_gpios` records, for each of chip0's address lines actually
//! included (in `chip0.address_pins()` order, from the starting index
//! above), which GPIO (within `[gpio_base, gpio_base + num_addr_pins)`)
//! it resolved to under the winning dual-bond combo - needed by
//! `build_rom_pin_map` to populate `OneromRomPinMap::addr`.
//!
//! Deliberately decoupled from `Chip`/`ChipSet` (which carry ROM image
//! data, CS config, filenames etc. - none of which this needs): takes just
//! the `ChipSetType` and the `ChipType`s involved, so it's directly
//! testable without constructing full chip-set objects.
