# CLI Changelog

## v0.4.1 - 2026-09-17

- **Add `onerom console`.**  Displays what One ROM sends, like `monitor log`,
  and sends what you type to the retro system, which reads it with RBCP
  `PIPE_READ`.  Requires firmware v0.7.3 with the USB and host-control plugins.
- **Add the `27C400Pin31A17` and `27C200Pin31NC` chip types**, for the Amiga
  A500 rev 5 Kickstart socket.

## v0.4.0 - 2026-09-08

- **`peek` and `poke` help no longer show an argument the commands reject.**
  Both gave `onerom peek live ...`, and the top-level aliases take their options
  directly.
- **A device that cannot be read is now named in one line and ignored.**
  `onerom scan` says whether it could not be opened or could not be read, warns
  only where nothing else was found, and adds the USB identity and the
  underlying error under `--verbose`. `--unrecognised` no longer picks one to
  program, since a device that will not answer cannot be programmed.
- **A ROM image smaller than the chip, with `size_handling=trunc`, no longer
  reports the image as too large.** It said the image was larger than the chip
  supported while printing a size smaller than the chip's. It now reads as too
  small, and points at padding or duplication.
- **Build errors name the ROM image at fault by its file.** They gave a chip
  number that counted plugin slots and every chip in a set, so nothing a
  `--slot` or a config entry produced it. A `location` window running past the
  end of its file now says so, instead of advising padding that cannot reach
  it, and an image too large for a 27C080 says that one One ROM serves half of
  one.
- **The CLI warns when a 16-bit ROM image looks to be stored the wrong way
  round.** A 16-bit ROM supplies two bytes at a time, an image may hold each
  pair in either order, and One ROM reads the low byte first. `program`,
  `firmware build` and `image swap-bytes` now compare the image's first bytes
  against known ROM headers and say what they recognised. An image matching
  none is left alone, and nothing is refused.
- **`onerom firmware inspect --verbose` lists plugins separately** and numbers
  ROM slots from 0 with plugins excluded, as `onerom inspect slots` already
  did. An image holding the USB plugin and two ROM images reported three slots.
- **`onerom program --reset-host <PIN>` resets the host system after
  programming.** It waits for the One ROM to come back on the USB bus and then
  pulses that pin low, as `control reset` does, so flashing an image and
  restarting the machine into it is one command. The pin is checked against the
  image being flashed - a pin One ROM will serve with, or one the board uses
  itself, is refused before its ROM images are fetched - and it runs for each device in
  a `--batch`. The pulse is 100ms; `control reset` remains the way to choose
  another. Conflicts with `--fast`, `--stopped` and `--no-reboot`.
- **`program --follow` says up front when the image cannot serve it.** An image
  with no USB system plugin leaves the bus the moment the One ROM starts
  serving, so there was never a log to follow - previously discovered after
  programming, when the port could not be found.
- **`--hold` is bounded where the device bounds it.** `control pin --hold` and
  `control reset --hold` refuse anything above the 60 second limit the device
  enforces, as the command line is read rather than after it has been sent.
- **`onerom inspect led --verbose` and `inspect rgb --verbose` now say when
  they could not reach the device**, instead of reporting that the two LEDs are
  not on the same GPIO.
- **`onerom control pin`, `control rgb` and `inspect gpio` now work first time
  against a One ROM running an older USB plugin.** They previously waited and
  then failed, and succeeded when run again.
- **`onerom control rgb` drives the RGB LED on the models that have one.**
  `on`, `off`, `beacon`, `flame`, `cycle`, `breathe` and `blink`, with
  `--colour` (ten names or `#RRGGBB`), `--brightness`, `--period` and `--hold`.
  The device times a hold, so it completes even if the command does not. A
  board without an RGB LED says so rather than appearing to work. Needs
  firmware v0.7.2 with the v0.2.2 USB plugin.
- **`onerom control led blink`** blinks the status LED on and off until
  something changes it, or for a `--hold` if you give it one. A slower,
  unbounded sibling of `beacon`.
- **Each LED mode now has a shortest period it can run at**, and a shorter one
  is refused with a message naming that mode's minimum rather than being
  accepted and quietly run slower. 1000ms for `cycle` and `breathe`, 500ms for
  `flame`, 50ms for `beacon` and `blink`.
- **`onerom inspect led` and `onerom inspect rgb` say what each LED is doing.**
  The mode it is in, how fast it is running and which GPIO it is on, plus the
  colour and brightness for the RGB LED, read from the One ROM rather than
  remembered by the CLI. A board with no RGB LED reports that rather than
  failing, and where the two LEDs share a GPIO both commands say so. Needs
  firmware v0.7.2 with the v0.2.2 USB plugin.
- **`onerom control led` gains `--hold` and `--period`.** All four
  subcommands take `--hold <MS>` to run the mode for a bounded time and then go
  back to whatever the LED was doing, and `beacon` and `flame` take
  `--period <MS>` for one blink and one pass of the flicker. The device times
  the hold, so it finishes even if the command does not. Needs firmware v0.7.2
  with the v0.2.2 USB plugin — the CLI checks first and says so, rather than
  reporting success on a device that would ignore them. A plain `on`, `off`,
  `beacon` or `flame` is unchanged and still works on any One ROM.
- **Breaking: `--name` now names the One ROM, not the configuration.** It is an
  alias for `--instance-name` on `program` and `firmware build`, where it was an
  alias for `--config-name` — a command line using `--name` still runs and names
  the device instead, except with `--no-config`, where it is now rejected.
  `docs/CLI-MANUAL.md` gains a breaking-changes section near the top and the
  full history at the end.
- **`onerom monitor log` shows a running One ROM's log as it is written.**
  It attaches to the One ROM's USB serial port and prints the firmware and
  plugin logging it sends, until the One ROM is disconnected, rebooted or
  stopped, or you press Ctrl-C. What the One ROM has logged since anything last
  listened arrives first, so the boot log is still there when you attach.
  `--output` keeps a transcript as well as showing it. Needs a running One ROM
  programmed with the USB system plugin. On Linux the packaged udev rules now
  tell ModemManager to leave One ROM alone — without that it probes the port and
  consumes the log before you get to it, so a hand-installed copy of the rules
  wants replacing.
- **`onerom program --follow`** goes straight from programming to watching the
  log, so you see the boot log of the firmware just flashed. It cannot be
  combined with `--fast`, `--stopped`, `--no-reboot` or `--batch`.
- **`onerom self` reports and downloads new releases of the CLI itself.**
  `self check` says whether a newer CLI has been published for your platform;
  `self download` fetches a published artifact — for this platform, another
  (`--target`), or all of them — and verifies it against its published SHA-256.
  Nothing is installed, and no check runs unless you ask for one.
- **A plugin named by a config is now checked for firmware compatibility**, as
  one given with `--plugin` already was. A plugin binary declares only the
  minimum firmware it needs, so a release withdrawn for a newer firmware — USB
  v0.1.2, which hard faults on v0.7.0 — was previously built in and flashed.
  A local or third-party plugin has nothing published to check against and is
  still built in as-is; an unreachable images server warns rather than failing.
  A refusal names the newest release that does support the firmware, with the
  URL to point the config at.
- **Motorola S-record images are now accepted alongside Intel HEX.**
  `--slot format=srec` decodes an S-record file to a binary image before it is
  built in, with the same optional `load-address=` giving the absolute address
  that maps to byte 0 of the ROM. Unwritten bytes read as `0xFF`.
- **`onerom image convert` gains `srec`** on either side of `--from`/`--to`, so
  it now converts between `binary`, `ihex` and `srec` in any direction,
  including `ihex` to `srec` directly. S-record output uses one data record
  type throughout — the narrowest that addresses the whole image — with the
  paired terminator.
- **`onerom program --verify` is supported**, and its help text and the CLI
  manual now say so. It reads flash back after programming and compares it
  against the image, and always did — both described it as not yet supported.
- **New 24, 32 and 40 pin boards** — `fire-24-g`, `fire-32-c` and `fire-40-c`.

## v0.3.0 - 2026-08-09

- **`--slot` now accepts every chip type the target firmware can serve on the
  board.** For v0.7.0 firmware onwards that is the served layout itself, so the
  overhang and fly-lead combinations `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md` documents — a
  `2764` on a Fire 24, a `28C16` on a Fire 28 — are accepted where they were
  previously refused as "not supported by this board". Building for v0.6.x is
  unchanged, and a rejection lists what that firmware does serve.
  - **Breaking: `--allow-unsupported-chip-type` is removed** from `program` and
    `firmware build`. It only ever bypassed the old per-board list; nothing it
    can now permit is buildable.

- **Breaking: the CLI's argument conventions are now consistent across every
  command.** No command takes a positional argument — `board header` and
  `board socket` take `--board`, where the error for omitting it already told
  you to. Each short flag means one thing CLI-wide: `-b` is `--board` (was
  `--byte` on `poke`), `-o` is `--output` (was `--offset` on `control erase`),
  `-i` is `--input` (was the global `--vid-pid`, which keeps `--id`), `-l` is
  `--length` (was `--slot`), and `-m` is `--msd` (was `--image` on
  `update slot`). `--board`, `--chip-type`, `--all`, `--force`, `--no-reboot`,
  `--input` and `--output` gain their short forms on the commands that lacked
  them. Enforced by tests that walk the whole command tree.
- **Breaking: `onerom control erase` uses `--stopped`/`--running`** for its
  post-erase reboot mode, matching `control reboot` and `program`. As with
  `onerom boards`, there is deliberately no alias for the old
  `--reboot-stopped`/`--reboot-running`.
- `--config` is now the primary spelling of the ROM configuration file option
  on `program` and `firmware build`, matching how it is written throughout the
  documentation; `--config-file`, `--config-json` and `--json` remain aliases.
- `onerom image convert` validates `--from`/`--to` as the command line is
  parsed and lists the accepted formats in `--help`, rather than failing
  part-way through a conversion. The list comes from `onerom-gen`, so a format
  added there needs no CLI change. `--load-address` is likewise parsed up
  front, by the same code the config file uses, so `$E000` and a bad value
  behave identically in both places.
- `--slot` keys and values are documented kebab-case — `size-handling`,
  `load-address`, `force-16-bit`, `cs1=active-low` — matching the CLI's own
  argument naming. The snake_case config spellings are all still accepted, and
  `size-handling`, the one key that took only the snake form, now parses.
- **`--slot` accepts `cs<n>=ignore`**, which a config file always could.
  Chip-select values now go through the same `onerom-gen` parser the config
  file uses, replacing a second, narrower copy in the CLI — between them
  `active_low` was accepted only on the command line and `ignore` only in a
  config file, and neither took the full set. `ignore` says One ROM does not
  monitor the line; whether a chip may use it is still settled by
  `allow_cs_ignore`, so a 2332 asking for it now gets that rule explained
  rather than "invalid CS logic".
- `--serial-override` now has help text and a `<SERIAL>` value name; it shipped
  with neither, from a `//` comment where clap needs `///`.
- **Breaking: `onerom boards` is now `onerom board`**, and the bare listing it
  printed is `onerom board list`. There is no alias, so scripts calling
  `onerom boards` must be updated; the CLI suggests `board` rather than simply
  failing.
- **Ice (STM32) boards are listed separately and rejected where the CLI cannot
  use them.** The CLI has never had an STM32 path — every firmware path
  composes an RP2350 image and every device path speaks picoboot — but the
  merged list implied otherwise, and `--board ice-24-d` failed several layers
  down as a missing release. `scan`, `program`, `firmware build`,
  `firmware download`, `firmware inspect --board`, `control pin`,
  `control reset` and `inspect gpio` now reject an Ice `--board` up front. The
  commands that only *describe* hardware still take them: `board header`,
  `board socket`, `chips` and `firmware releases`.
- **Add GPIO control**: `onerom control pin` drives a One ROM GPIO high, low or
  high-impedance, `onerom control reset` pulses one low to reset the host
  system One ROM is installed in, and `onerom inspect gpio` shows what every
  GPIO is and what One ROM is doing with it. All three need a *running* device
  with the USB system plugin, and say so.
  - `control pin --hold <MS>` holds the state for a bounded period and then
    applies `--then` (`z` by default); without `--hold` the state latches. The
    **device** times the hold, so an interrupted CLI cannot leave a pin
    latched. `control reset` is that with `--state low --then z` and `--hold`
    defaulting to 100ms; it never drives the line high, and rejects `--hold 0`.
  - `--pin` takes `gpio<N>` or a header pad name — `sel_a` to `sel_e` (`sel-a`
    and `sela` accepted) and `x1`/`x2`. A bare number is rejected as ambiguous,
    as are the broken-out address pads (`a<N>`), with a reason. `--state` and
    `--then` accept `1`/`0` alongside `high`/`low`.
  - A GPIO One ROM is itself using is refused, naming what it is doing, unless
    `--force`, which prints what forcing costs: a pin serving *reads* goes back
    with `--state z`, a pin serving *drives* leaves serving broken until
    reboot. A GPIO that is not 5V-tolerant warns, which `--yes` or `--force`
    answers.
  - `control pin`, `control reset` and `inspect gpio` take `--board`, needed
    only to resolve a `--pin` pad name on a board this build does not
    recognise.

  Requires One ROM firmware v0.7.1 or later and the v0.7.1 or later USB system
  plugin; against anything older the CLI says which of the two is too old
  rather than surfacing a USB stall.

- **Add ASCII views of a board's physical pin layouts.** `onerom board header
  [--board <board>]` draws the pin (jumper / programming) header, annotating each
  image-select and X pad with the GPIO behind it and — on Fire boards —
  whether that GPIO is 5V-tolerant (`5V`) or 3.3V-only (`!!3V3!!`, an ADC pin).
  `onerom board socket [--board <board>] [--chip-type <chip>] [--gpio]` draws the ROM
  socket as a DIP pinout: GPIOs by default, ROM pin functions with
  `--chip-type`, and both with `--gpio`. A chip whose pin count differs from
  the board's is drawn at the larger of the two, bottom-justified, marking
  `overhang` and `(empty)` pins and the `X1`/`X2` fly-lead each overhanging
  address line needs. The board is inferred from a connected One ROM when
  omitted; `onerom inspect header` and `onerom inspect socket` are the
  device-side forms, and take `--board` to override the board type the
  connected One ROM reports.
- **`onerom chips --board <board>` now reports how much flash each chip type
  uses.** Each chip is listed with its ROM size and its image size — often
  larger than the chip (a 2364 costs 8KB on a 24-pin board but 256KB
  overhanging a 28-pin one) — grouped by socket fit, matching
  `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`. `--chip-type <chip>` (`-c`) answers for one type,
  and `board socket --chip-type` / `inspect socket --chip-type` report the same
  figure below the pinout. The listing now covers every chip the board can
  emulate, including the overhang and fly-lead combinations the name-only list
  omitted; a recognised type the board cannot serve is named in a trailing line
  instead. Ice boards keep the plain name list.
  - The Fit column is now legended, and the fit for a chip in a larger socket
    needing no signal wiring reads `larger socket (no fly-leads)` rather than
    `no fly-leads required`, which sat under a `(with fly-leads)` heading and
    read as a contradiction.
- **ROM images can be rearranged during a build**, via a new `transform=` key
  on `--slot`: `swap_bytes` reverses the byte order within each 16-bit word,
  and `deinterleave:<offset>/<stride>[/<bytes>]` extracts one lane from an
  interleaved image. Several may be combined with `+` and are applied in the
  order given, which matters. The same is expressible as a `"transform"` array
  in a config file. Previously the only option was `onerom image swap-bytes`,
  which rewrites the source file.
- **Add `onerom image deinterleave`** — the standalone counterpart to
  `onerom image swap-bytes` (`--offset`, `--stride`, `--bytes`). Both share
  their implementation with the `transform=` slot key. Neither reads Intel HEX;
  run `onerom image convert` first.
- Add `onerom image convert --from <fmt> --to <fmt> --input <file> --output
  <file> [--load-address <addr>]`, converting ROM images between `binary` and
  `ihex` (Intel HEX). The format set is designed to accept further formats
  later.
- Add `format` and `load_address` keys to `--slot` for Intel HEX ROM images:
  `--slot file=rom.hex,type=2364,cs1=active_low,format=ihex[,load_address=$E000]`.
  `format` accepts `binary` (default) or `ihex`; `load_address` (only valid
  with `format=ihex`) is a decimal or `0x`/`$`-prefixed address mapping to byte
  0 of the ROM. The same keys are available in config files.
- Add `--serial-override`, setting a custom USB serial number used while One
  ROM is running. A stopped One ROM continues to use its chip ID.
- Allow `--plugin` to be combined with `--config-file` on `program` and
  `firmware build`; the plugins are inserted ahead of the config's ROM slots.
  Errors if the config already defines a plugin of its own.
- Turbo boot with more than one non-plugin ROM slot is now accepted under
  `--force` rather than refused outright, for a first slot holding a bootloader
  that selects the others itself. `--force` now covers config warnings as well
  as firmware parse errors and a board type mismatch.
- The ROM type is now stored in metadata using the exact spelling the user
  entered, on both the `--config-file` (`"type"`) and `--slot type=...` paths,
  instead of a canonicalised name (`27SF512` is retained rather than normalised
  to `27512`). The resolved type still drives all behaviour.
- `onerom scan --list-boards` now prints the same listing as `onerom board
  list` rather than its own one-liner.
- `onerom inspect gpio` now shows one `Function` column instead of separate
  `Pad` and `Function` columns, listing everything the GPIO is: its ROM socket
  signal under the image being served, then the board peripheral, then the
  header pad, deduplicated.
  - This **fixes a real omission**: the lookup stopped at the first system
    function it matched, so on a `fire-24-f` — where the Status LED and the RGB
    LED are both GPIO 29 — the table named only the Status LED.
  - `Function` no longer claims a GPIO is `SWCLK` or `SWDIO`. Those are
    dedicated RP2350 pins with no GPIO of their own; the `SEL_C`/`SEL_D` pads
    merely share their nets. `onerom inspect header` remains the pad-indexed
    view.
- `onerom inspect gpio` now lists only the GPIOs connected to something, saying
  how many were omitted; `--all` lists every GPIO. The `X1`/`X2` and
  image-select pads always appear, being what the table is read to find.
- The explanatory legend under the `inspect gpio` table is now shown only with
  `--verbose`.
- `board socket` and `inspect socket` now say when a board has no GPIO map,
  instead of drawing the diagram with the GPIO column blank all the way down.
  The `--chip-type` function view is unaffected, being drawn from the chip's
  pinout rather than the socket map.
- `board header` and `inspect header` now say `command unsupported` for a board
  with no pin-header descriptor, where they said `nothing to draw` and called
  the descriptor missing "yet".
- `onerom inspect header` and `onerom inspect socket` now take `--board`,
  overriding the board type the connected One ROM reports, as `inspect gpio`
  already did. It is an override, not a substitute for the device — both still
  need a One ROM connected, and `onerom board header`/`board socket` remain the
  way to draw a board by name without one.
  - Their "cannot determine the board type" error now advises `--board`, which
    resolves it. The error only arises with a One ROM connected whose board type
    this build does not recognise, so the previous advice to connect one was
    unreachable.
- Stop hard-wrapping prose in console output. A handful of messages broke a
  sentence at a fixed width, which the terminal then wrapped again at its own.
  Multi-line messages that put a *separate* sentence on its own indented line
  are unchanged; that is structure, not wrapping.
- Fix `onerom image swap-bytes` panicking at startup (even for `--help`) with a
  clap short-option collision: `-i` was claimed by both the global `--vid-pid`
  and swap-bytes' `--input`. `-i` now belongs to `--input` throughout, and
  `--vid-pid` is long-only (alias `--id` unchanged).
- New `Error` variants: `ImageTransform`, `IceBoardUnsupported`,
  `TurboBootMultiSlot`, and the GPIO control errors (device not running, pin
  in use, no free hold slot).
- `--disable-swd` now takes effect on the device: SWD stays up for the whole of
  boot and is shut off just before serving. It may now be combined with
  `--logging`, previously rejected, and logging stops when SWD does. Its help
  text now says what it does and does not do.
- Fix `firmware build` accepting `--swd_disabled` where `program` accepted
  `--swd_disable`, so each underscore spelling worked on only one subcommand.
  `--disable-swd` and `--swd-disable` are unchanged and work on both.
