# One ROM CLI

This directory contains the source code and build scripts for the One ROM command-line interface (CLI) tool.

The CLI is a Rust application that provides a cross-platform CLI to manage One ROMs, including those with the USB plugin to provide management of One ROM while running (serving bytes).

For instructions on using the CLI, see [The CLI manual](/docs/CLI-MANUAL.md).

## Building

With the One ROM [build environment](/INSTALL.md) installed, from this directory:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

To build the Windows artifacts you need a Windows build machine — see
[Setting up a Windows build machine](/docs/SETUP-WINDOWS-BUILD-MACHINE.md).

## Releasing

`onerom-cli` has two release channels:

- **The `onerom` binary** — cross-platform CLI artifacts distributed via
  https://onerom.org/cli and tagged `cli-vX.Y.Z`. Steps below.
- **The `onerom-cli` library crate** — published to crates.io as part of the
  main One ROM release (see [RELEASE.md](/RELEASE.md)). Studio and other
  applications build on this library, so it is published consistently alongside
  its dependencies (`onerom-app`, `onerom-config`, `onerom-fw`, `onerom-gen`,
  `onerom-fw-parser`, `onerom-metadata`).

### Binary release

1. Check whether [the CLI manual](/docs/CLI-MANUAL.md) needs updating for this
    release, including its "as of release vX.Y.Z" banner.  The manual's PDF also
    contains [the overview](/docs/OVERVIEW.md), so check that too.  Do this
    first — step 4 renders the manual to PDF, so any correction has to be in
    before then.

2. Build the release artifacts for all platforms:

    ```bash
    scripts/build-release.sh pin=WIN_SIGNING_PIN
    ```

    Artifacts are placed in the `dist/` directory.

3. Update the CLI release manifest and copy the artifacts to the One ROM images repo.  Assuming ../../../one-rom-images exists:

    ```bash
    scripts/release.py --input-dir dist --output-dir ../../../one-rom-images
    ```

4. Build and stage the CLI manual PDF, so the manual is published with the
    binary it documents.  From the repository root:

    ```bash
    ci/build-docs.sh ../one-rom-images --source cli
    ```

    `--source cli` selects the documents on the CLI's release cycle, which is
    the manual alone — the chip references move with the firmware and are
    published by its release instead.  The toolchain is installed once with
    `ci/install-doc-tools.sh`, which prints a directory to put on `PATH`.

    The manual is staged at
    `one-rom-images/docs/cli-manual/vX.Y.Z/` and merged into that document's
    `releases.json`.  The script does not set `latest` - review the diff and set
    it there.

5. Commit the changes to the one-rom-images repo and push:
    ```bash
    cd ../../../one-rom-images
    git add .
    git commit -m "Update One ROM CLI releases"
    git push
    ```

6. Tag the current commit with the version and push:

    ```bash
    git tag cli-vX.Y.Z
    git push origin cli-vX.Y.Z
    ```

7. Check new releases appear at https://onerom.org/cli/
