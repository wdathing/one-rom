//! The USB CDC serial port a running One ROM presents.
//!
//! A One ROM running the USB system plugin enumerates a CDC ACM interface
//! alongside the vendor interface picoboot uses. The plugin forwards One ROM's
//! log into that port's IN endpoint while a terminal has the port open, so
//! reading it is how the CLI shows firmware and plugin logging.
//!
//! The port is reached through the operating system's own CDC class driver -
//! cdc_acm, AppleUSBCDCACM or usbser - rather than by claiming the interface
//! over USB directly, because that driver owns the interface on every platform
//! the CLI ships for.
//!
//! Two things gate what arrives:
//!
//! - The device forwards only while DTR is asserted, which is what marks a
//!   terminal as having the port open. [`stream`] asserts it explicitly rather
//!   than relying on the platform doing so at open.
//! - A debug probe reading the log over SWD consumes the same bytes. Both
//!   advance the same read position, so a probe and this command running at
//!   once split the stream arbitrarily between them and neither sees all of it.
