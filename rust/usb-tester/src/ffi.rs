//! Declarations for the host shim (`csrc/usb_shim.c`).
//!
//! The shim supplies the plugin with the parts of its device environment that
//! do not exist in a host process: tinyusb, picoboot, and an entry point.
//! These are the controls it offers a scenario on top of that.
//!
//! The three entry points the harness itself needs —
//! `ora_host_test_run_plugin`, `ora_host_test_set_yield_hook` and
//! `ora_host_test_plugin_version` — are declared by `onerom-plugin-tester` and
//! resolved against this crate's shim at the final link.
