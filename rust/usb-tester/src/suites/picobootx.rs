//! One ROM's picoboot extension: the commands this plugin adds under its own
//! magic.
//!
//! picobootx's own conformance suite covers the protocol — framing, the stall
//! and unstall sequence, ZLPs, the transfer state machine, command status.  None
//! of that is repeated here.  What this suite asserts is the part picobootx
//! cannot: the plugin's `dispatch` and `fill`, the arguments they accept and
//! refuse, and the address ranges it claims.
//!
//! A scenario stands where the core stands, calling the handlers through the
//! table the plugin registered with `picoboot_init`.  Taking the table from the
//! plugin rather than building one means the registration is under test too.
//!
//! What this cannot see is the core's side of the contract: if picobootx
//! changed whether it masks the direction bit before calling dispatch, these
//! scenarios would stay green while the device changed.  A signature change
//! still breaks the build, and picobootx's own suite covers the core's calling
//! convention against a sample implementation.
