//! Bounded GPIO holds: the part of GPIO control the plugin owns rather than the
//! firmware.
//!
//! `ora_gpio_set` owns the safety model and refuses a pin One ROM is using.
//! What the plugin owns is the timing of a bounded hold, and the rule the whole
//! feature exists for: a pin must never be left asserted with nothing scheduled
//! to release it.  Every scenario here is a way that could go wrong — a hold
//! superseded, a hold cancelled, the hold entries exhausted — and what the pin
//! is doing afterwards is read back through the firmware.
//!
//! The commands themselves are covered in the picobootx suite.  This is what
//! happens over the passes that follow one.
