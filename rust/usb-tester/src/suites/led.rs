//! The LEDs a SET_LED addresses, and the modes that outlive the command that
//! started them.
//!
//! The command names a channel, and both the channels a device has belong to
//! the firmware's LED engine.  The plugin forwards and reports what the engine
//! answered - it holds no LED state of its own - so a command is applied as it
//! is answered, and a refusal reaches the host rather than being discovered a
//! pass later.
//!
//! A mode that carries on afterwards - a beacon, a flame, a fade - is driven by
//! the engine from a timer interrupt.  This process has no interrupt, so a
//! scenario stands where it does: `engine_frame` moves the clock to the
//! deadline the engine named and runs the frame.
//!
//! What the status LED is doing is read back through the firmware's own
//! `status_led_enabled`, which is the live state and the channel the other
//! plugin reads — so a scenario asserts the same thing another plugin would
//! see, rather than the plugin's private copy.  What the RGB LED is doing is
//! read back through `ORA_ID_LED_GET`, for the same reason: it is the engine's
//! state, not the plugin's account of what it asked for.
//!
//! What this suite cannot see is the pixel.  The engine's colour is asserted
//! where the plugin put it, not on the wire the WS2812 reads, so a fault in the
//! engine's own PIO output would leave these green.  Nor can it see a board's
//! RGB LED where there is none: the engine refuses every request for an LED the
//! board does not have, so the scenarios that need one skip there and only the
//! refusal is covered.
