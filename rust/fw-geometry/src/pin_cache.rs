//! `PinCache::build` does the O(pins) mapping work once so the hot test loop
//! can operate purely on pre-resolved GPIO numbers.
//!
//! For secondary chips in a multi-ROM set (`chips[1]`, `chips[2]`, …) that are
//! not in One ROM's socket, use `PinCache::build_secondary`.  These chips share
//! the address and data bus with the primary chip (`chips[0]`) and are selected
//! by an X pin acting as their unique CS line.
