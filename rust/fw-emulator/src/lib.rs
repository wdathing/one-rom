//! `onerom-fw-emulator` — safe Rust interface to the One ROM firmware
//! emulation layer.
//!
//! Builds `libonerom-test.a` via `build.rs` and provides:
//!
//! * [`ffi`] — raw, unsafe bindgen-generated bindings (escape hatch)
//! * [`Emulator`] — safe wrapper for test code
//! * [`driver`] — GPIO bitmask builders shared by the tester and One ROM Lens
//! * [`build_options`] — the logging the C under test was compiled with

// The bitmask builders that feed `Emulator::drive_gpios` need no emulator to
// compute, so they live in `onerom-fw-driver` — a crate with no build script
// and no dependencies of its own, so this re-export costs One ROM Lens's wasm
// build nothing.  Re-exported so existing `onerom_fw_emulator::driver` paths
// keep working.

/// `build.rs` records them as cfgs on this crate, and a cfg reaches only the
/// crate whose build script emitted it, so they are re-published here for the
