//! Error types for `onerom-app`.
//!
//! There are two, reflecting the crate's pure/transport split:
//!
//! - [`PluginError`] is the pure, structured error returned by every
//!   synchronous decision function (manifest parsing, release selection,
//!   binary verification, config generation). Its variants carry structured
//!   data - names, versions, sizes - and its [`Display`](core::fmt::Display)
//!   output states *facts only*. It deliberately contains no application
//!   specific guidance (for example "run `onerom plugin` to list plugins"):
//!   that phrasing belongs to whichever application is reporting the error, and
//!   is added there.
//!
//! - [`Error`] is returned by the asynchronous entry points that delegate
//!   fetching to a [`PluginFetch`](crate::PluginFetch) implementation. It is
//!   generic over the host's transport error type `E` and carries it back out
//!   untouched, so the host retains full typed access to its own fetch failures
//!   (for example distinguishing a connection failure from an HTTP status
//!   code). The crate never inspects or stringifies `E`.
