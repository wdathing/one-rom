//! Tests for the plugin logging API (`ORA_ID_LOG_*`).
//!
//! # What is being tested, and what is not
//!
//! The ring itself is covered by the host C tests in `firmware/test/rtt/`,
//! which drive `onerom_rtt_read`/`_write`/`_query` directly and mutation-check
//! their own coverage. What only the emulator can reach is the layer above:
//! the claim tables, the caller identity the claims are keyed on, and whether
//! each documented return code is the one actually produced.
//!
//! # Standing in for two plugins
//!
//! On a device the calling plugin is derived from `SIO_CPUID`, because core 1
//! runs the system plugin and core 0 the user plugin, so a plugin cannot claim
//! to be the other one. There is no such register on the host, so the harness
//! says instead, through `set_calling_plugin`. Every test that matters here is
//! about one plugin being kept out of another's claim, so switching identity
//! between calls is the whole point rather than a convenience.
//!
//! Claims persist for the life of the emulator instance, so each test releases
//! what it took. A test that leaves a claim behind fails the next one, which is
//! a nuisance rather than a hazard, but it also makes an accidental leak
//! visible instead of silent.
