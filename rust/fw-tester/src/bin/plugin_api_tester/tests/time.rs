//! Tests for the firmware's millisecond time base.
//!
//! On a device the count comes from TIMER0's free-running microsecond counter.
//! There is no TIMER0 in this process, so the firmware reads its two halves
//! from a harness-owned script instead (see `stub_timer_raw_hi` and siblings in
//! `firmware/test/stub_rp235x.c`). The code that assembles the halves is the
//! same in both builds, so it is the real thing under test here. That is what
//! makes the interesting cases reachable: the microsecond-to-millisecond
//! conversion, the 49.7 day wrap, and a counter that moves mid-read would
//! otherwise need a test to wait hours or days of wall time.
