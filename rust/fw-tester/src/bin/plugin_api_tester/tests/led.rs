//! Tests for the LED plugin API (`ORA_ID_LED_SET` and `ORA_ID_LED_GET`).
//!
//! # What these own, and what they leave alone
//!
//! The engine's shape - that a hue walks, that a breath fades, that a beacon
//! ends - is asserted by the USB plugin tester's LED suite, which drives this
//! same engine through the plugin's SET_LED command.  What that suite cannot
//! reach is the API boundary: it says only what its argument block can carry,
//! and it never calls `ora_led_set` at all.  So these tests own the contract -
//! the sizes, the refusals, the defaults and the state a caller reads back -
//! and take the animation only as far as proving a hold ends and gives the LED
//! back.
//!
//! # Where the expected answers come from
//!
//! The defaults and the floors are `onerom_metadata`'s `LED_*` constants, from
//! the metadata schema the firmware itself compiles against, so neither side
//! states a number the other does not.  Presence and the GPIO come from the
//! `GPIO_STATUS` and `GPIO_NEOPIXEL` metadata keys rather than from the engine,
//! so an engine answering from its own idea of the board fails here.
//!
//! # The clock
//!
//! Holds and frames are in the milliseconds `ora_get_plugin_uptime_ms` reports,
//! which in this process is a harness-owned counter rather than TIMER0.  Each
//! test places it where it needs it, and there is no interrupt to run a frame,
//! so a test stands where the interrupt does: move the clock to the deadline
//! the engine named, then run the frame.
