//! One ROM Address-Monitor Tester
//!
//! Drives the firmware's address-monitor plugin API (`setup_address_monitor`,
//! `init_knock`, `start_address_monitor`, `wait_for_knock`,
//! `get_address_monitor_ring_write_pos`) against the PIO/DMA emulator and
//! verifies that CS-active bus accesses are captured into the ring buffer and
//! that a knock sequence is detected.  The monitor is what an RBCP plugin is
//! built on; this exercises the monitor itself, independent of RBCP semantics.
//!
//! Layer 1 (capture pipeline) is deterministic: it drives one CS-active access
//! and asserts the ring write pointer advanced and the captured word demangles
//! to the driven address.  Layer 2 drives a full `"!RBCP!"` knock through the
//! real (blocking) `wait_for_knock`, fed by the yield hook, with a watchdog
//! timeout so a broken capture path fails the case rather than hanging.
//!
//! Addresses are driven on, and checked in, the *observed* (bus) address space
//! — the lines the device actually monitors, which on the 40-pin variant
//! exclude the ROM's least-significant address line.  That is the space
//! host-to-device command signalling travels in.  A 16-bit-capable chip is
//! exercised in both `/BYTE` modes, and in byte mode Layer 1 additionally
//! drives A-1 (the byte-within-word select) both ways and requires the captured
//! address to be identical — A-1 must never leak into command decode.
//!
//! Env: `CONFIG` (config JSON), `BOARD` (e.g. `fire-24-a`), optional
//! `BASE_DIR`, `ONEROM_LOG=1`.  Exits 0 if all cases pass, 1 otherwise.
