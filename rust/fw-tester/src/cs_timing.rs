//! Whether the byte on the data bus was really fetched for the read being made
//! — this address, with these chip selects asserted — or is merely a byte that
//! happens to match.
//!
//! The bulk read pass cannot tell the two apart.  It compares the bus against
//! the oracle, and a fetch made *before* CS asserted satisfies that comparison
//! equally well: a single-chip image is replicated across every SRAM index bit
//! the chip's address lines do not drive, so an entry fetched with the wrong
//! chip-select bits holds the same byte.  What the pass establishes is that *a*
//! matching byte was present, not that the device produced it for this read.
//!
//! What separates them is *when* the byte appears.  A fetch launched by this
//! read costs the address state machine another pass round its loop before the
//! DMA and data machines can run; a stale one is already on the pins.  So this
//! module measures the CS-to-data latency and asserts it exactly — which is the
//! question "was this byte fetched for this read", put in a form the bus can
//! answer.
//!
//! That is not a theoretical gap.  `CYCLES_CS_TO_DATA_MULTI` sat a cycle below
//! the real requirement for as long as it did because nothing could see it.
//!
//! # Why this is its own check
//!
//! [`crate::timing`]'s `CYCLES_*` are the settling margins the bulk pass waits
//! before sampling.  They have to be *correct*, or that pass reports failures
//! which are the tester's fault — so they cannot also serve as the assertion,
//! because a correct margin has slack in it by definition.
//!
//! Asserting the latency exactly is the stricter statement, and it fails in
//! both directions: too slow means serving regressed, too fast means the check
//! has quietly stopped discriminating and is passing on a stale fetch again.
//!
//! # What it does
//!
//! Three steps:
//!
//! 1. **Find the SRAM byte this read fetches** — not calculate it, find it, by
//!    flooding half the slot with a distinguishable value and seeing whether
//!    the bus returns it (`Probe::find_lane_offset`).  The index is the sampled
//!    GPIO word, and which of its bits reach the index — after input inversion,
//!    forced-low overrides, and pins the tester never drives — is easy to model
//!    wrongly and impossible to notice having modelled wrongly, because a wrong
//!    offset still holds the right byte.
//! 2. **Plant a value only this read can return** (`Probe::choose_marker`,
//!    `Probe::mark`).
//! 3. **Sample at a repeatable moment** ([`Probe::serves_at`]), and assert the
//!    marker appears at the expected cycle count and *not* one cycle earlier.
//!
//! # Traps
//!
//! Each of these produced a check that passed while measuring nothing.
//!
//! * The marker cannot just be the complement of the original byte.  A read
//!   that is too early fetches a *different* entry holding an unrelated byte,
//!   and one time in 256 per lane that byte is the complement.
//! * Every data lane must be located before any marker is written: the search
//!   in step 1 restores the slot as it narrows, so marking one lane and then
//!   searching for the next erases the first.
//! * The address state machine free-runs, so the answer depends on where CS
//!   assertion lands in its loop, and a read cycle's length is not a multiple of
//!   that loop.  The sweep has to be aligned rather than started wherever the
//!   previous read left off, or the same cycle count comes out both sufficient
//!   and insufficient within a single run.
//!
//! # What the latency should be
//!
//! It depends on whether the address state machine samples one of the chip's
//! control lines.  If it does, asserting CS changes the SRAM index, so the
//! fetch already in flight is discarded and redone; if it does not, CS only has
//! to switch the output drivers on.  The two differ by roughly a factor of two.
//!
//! Which case applies is a property of the board's routing as much as the chip,
//! so it is derived from configuration by
//! [`onerom_gen::compat::serving_alg_info`] rather than assumed per chip type —
//! see [`expected_cs_to_data`].
