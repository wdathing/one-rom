# build-docs.sh - Render the One ROM documentation set to PDF, and stage it for
# one-rom-images (images.onerom.org).
#
# The set itself, and every string that appears in a PDF but not in its source
# markdown, is defined in docs/pdf/docs.toml.  Nothing document-specific is
# stated in this script - it resolves the toolchain, runs the renderer and
# stages what comes out.
#
# Each document is versioned as the thing it documents, not as the repository:
# the CLI manual tracks the onerom-cli crate version, the chip compatibility and
# chip type references track the firmware version.  Each is read from the
# authoritative file at build time, so there is nothing to keep in step by hand.
#
# The two generated documents, COMPATIBILITY.md and CHIP-TYPES.md, are rendered
# from the committed markdown and are NOT regenerated here.  ci/rust-tests.sh
# already fails if the committed copy differs from a fresh regeneration, so once
# that gate is green the committed file is current by definition - regenerating
# would only dirty the tree against the check that just passed.  Run the gate
# before this script, not inside it.
#
# A value a document states and something else owns - a hold limit from the
# metadata schema, the CLI's own version - is different, because nothing here
# would notice it going stale.  Those are marked in the markdown and checked by
# rust/doc-gen, which render.py runs for every document it reads from the
# working tree.  Nothing is rewritten: a stale value stops the build and is an
# edit for whoever moved the constant.  Past editions, which name a git ref,
# are read as they shipped and are not checked - so an archive build needs no
# Rust toolchain.
#
# Usage: build-docs.sh [dest-prefix] [--source NAME] [--config PATH]
#
# --source names a version source from docs.toml, and so selects the documents
# that ship on that release cycle.  This matters because the documents do not
# all release together: the CLI manual moves with the onerom-cli crate, the chip
# references with the firmware, and each is published by its own release.  Build
# the whole set from one of them and you republish documents whose version has
# not moved, overwriting bytes readers already have.
#
#   ci/build-docs.sh ../one-rom-images --source firmware   # firmware release
#   ci/build-docs.sh ../one-rom-images --source cli        # CLI release
#
# With no --source every document is built, which is what CI wants - it renders
# the whole set to prove none of them breaks the renderer, and publishes nothing.
#
# --config selects a different set - docs/pdf/archive.toml holds past editions,
# rendered from the git ref they shipped at, built on demand rather than every
# release.
#
# Every document is built in each paper size docs.toml lists, currently A4 and
# US Letter - the readership is split across both, and a set built for one
# prints with shifted margins on the other.
#
# With a destination prefix the PDFs are staged into images.onerom.org, laid out
# as every other product there is:
#
#   docs/docs.json                        an index, as plugins/plugins.json is
#   docs/<slug>/releases.json             as plugins/user/blink/releases.json is
#   docs/<slug>/v<version>/<files>
#
# Each document's releases.json accumulates its editions, so a reader on an
# older CLI or firmware can still fetch the one matching their build.  It
# carries no hand-curated fields, so the merge is done here rather than by
# pasting a fragment - inserting a release into a nested array by hand is a poor
# use of a release evening.  Like build-images.sh, this script deliberately does
# not touch `latest`: publishing a document and making it the current one stay
# separate steps.

# A document may be assembled from several of the markdown files in docs/ - the
