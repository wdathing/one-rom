# --no-deps confines this pass to lab's own code.  Without it, clippy also lints
# the workspace crates lab depends on - onerom-config, onerom-protocol and
# onerom-database - under nightly's lint set rather than stable's, so a lint
# promoted to warn-by-default in nightly fails the build over a file the host
# pass above already covers on stable.  That is not hypothetical: it happened to
# `matches![...]` in onerom-config's build script, which is nursery (allow) on
# stable and warn-by-default on nightly.  All three crates are linted in the host
# pass, so nothing loses coverage here.
