# Build instrumented, run testers, and capture one tracefile.
#
# Usage: ci/coverage-run.sh <board> <config> [tester ...]
#
# Testers are named in ci/coverage-testers.txt and default to all of them.
# Coverage from every tester in one invocation accumulates into a single
# tracefile, because the counters sit next to the objects and the objects are
# not rebuilt between testers of the same board and config.
#
# One tracefile per (board, config), written to build/coverage and stamped with
# the commit it was captured at.  ci/coverage-report.sh merges them, and is
# separate so that re-reporting - or reporting at a different granularity -
# never re-runs a build.  Changing board or config rebuilds the C, which is why
# the split is there at all: coverage cannot accumulate in place across those.
#
# Nothing is written if a tester fails.  A repo where a test fails is a repo in
# a bad state, and a coverage figure taken from it means nothing.
