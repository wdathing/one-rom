# Install the host C compiler the firmware's host builds are measured with.
#
# One version, everywhere: CI, the build container, and a developer's own
# machine all install through this script, so a coverage figure and a -Werror
# failure mean the same thing wherever they are produced.  The version is
# pinned in ci/c-compiler-version - see that file before changing it.
#
# The pin tracks the major version of the Arm toolchain in
# ci/arm-toolchain-version, because that is the compiler the firmware actually
# ships from.  firmware/Makefile and firmware/test.mk set no -std, so the C the
# device is built as is whatever that compiler defaults to, and a host build
# that wants to be a test of the firmware's C has to be the same generation.
# ci/c-tests.sh builds with -Werror, so the warnings it gates on are that
# compiler's warnings.
#
# Taken from ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test rather than the distribution, because
# Ubuntu 24.04 archives nothing newer than gcc-14.  A source build is the
# alternative and costs an hour per image.
#
# Usage: ci/install-c-compiler.sh [version]
#   version   gcc major version (default: the pinned ci/c-compiler-version)
#
# Progress goes to stderr and the compiler's name to stdout, so the caller can
# do:
#
#   export CC="$(ci/install-c-compiler.sh)"
#
# Re-running with the compiler already present is a no-op.
