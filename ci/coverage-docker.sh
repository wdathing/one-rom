#
# Coverage needs GNU gcc and libgcov, so ci/coverage-run.sh refuses to run
# anywhere but Linux.  This is how a developer on another platform gets the same
# figures: the same script, in the container ci/docker builds, with the tree
# copied in rather than mounted.
#
# Copied rather than mounted for two reasons.  Cargo keys its fingerprints on
# the host it built for, so a Linux build sharing rust/target with a macOS one
# makes each of them rebuild the whole workspace every time they alternate.  And
# a run that cannot write to the tree cannot leave anything behind in it.
#
# Tracefiles come back to build/coverage, which is where ci/coverage-report.sh
# looks for them.  Report separately, on the host - it reads tracefiles and
# needs no toolchain.

# What to copy in.  git ls-files rather than a list of excludes: an exclude
# pattern for build output also matches rust/config/build and its siblings,
# which are build scripts and are source.
#
# Untracked files too, filtered by the ignore rules, because a new script is
# source before it is committed - and a coverage run is how one gets tested.
# Without this the container silently runs the tree as it was, and the failure
# it produces points anywhere but here.
#
# apio and epio are their own repositories and so are not tracked here, but the
# firmware does not build without them.  Their build output is left behind: a
# host-built libepio.a copied into the container is the wrong architecture, and
# make sees a library newer than its sources and does not rebuild it, so the
# link fails on every epio symbol.
