# Usage: ci/coverage-campaign.sh [--keep]
#
#   --keep   leave existing tracefiles in place, so an interrupted campaign
#            can be resumed.  Without it the set is cleared first, because a
#            tracefile left over from a campaign definition that has since
#            changed is exactly what the report will refuse.
#
# This takes hours.  It is what moves the floors, not something to run in the
# edit loop - for that, run ci/coverage-run.sh against one board and config.
#
# The same script is what CI runs, so the two cannot drift into measuring
# different sets.
