# Turn coverage tracefiles into figures, a line list, or a pass/fail gate.
#
# Usage: ci/coverage-report.sh [mode] [tracefile ...]
#
#   (no mode)          per-file table, grouped by component, with totals
#   --uncovered [PATH] the lines nothing reached, optionally for one file
#   --check            fail if any file is below its baseline floor
#   --raise            raise the baseline to today's figures
#   --badges           write a badge JSON per component into build/coverage/badges
#
# Tracefiles default to every build/coverage/*.info, which is every
# (board, config) captured so far - so the same command gives one variant or
# all of them combined, depending on what you pass.
#
# Line coverage only.  Function records are present in a tracefile and are
# ignored here, and branch records are not even captured - ci/coverage-run.sh
# does not ask lcov for them.  That is deliberate: one number per file that
# anyone can reason about beats a richer one nobody reads.  It does mean this
# cannot see inside a switch, so an untested arm of a macro-generated dispatch
# reads as covered.
#
# Merging happens here rather than in lcov: for line coverage the rule is that
# a line is covered if any run covered it, which is a union, and doing it here
# keeps this script working with whatever lcov the machine has.  ci/coverage-run.sh
# is the only thing that needs lcov at all.
#
# The two figures serve different ends and both are needed.  The table is a
# ratchet - it exists so coverage cannot quietly go backwards, and so something
# new cannot be added with no test.  The line list is how you improve it: what
# is left after every tester, on every variant, is either a test nobody has
# written, a path the harness cannot reach, or something that genuinely needs
# real hardware, and only reading the lines tells you which.
