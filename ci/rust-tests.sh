#
# Against git it asked the wrong question.  A file like docs/CLI-MANUAL.md is
# only partly generated - the assembler rewrites the text between its fragment
# markers and leaves the rest of the document alone - so diffing the whole file
# against the index reported a developer's own hand-written prose as a stale
# generated file, and passed only once that prose was staged.  What matters is
# whether the generator produced something different from what is committed,
# which a snapshot answers directly, on a dirty working tree or a clean one, and
# without needing a git work tree at all.
#
# docs/CHIP-TYPES.md is why the snapshot is taken this early: the onerom-config
# build script rewrites it on any build, so by the first cargo command below it
# has already been regenerated and a later snapshot would compare it to itself.

# A markdown file in docs/ may carry a fragment region, whose text belongs to

# check as any other generated file.  Only the region is rewritten, which is why
# the check compares against a snapshot: the rest of the host is hand-written
# prose that a developer is entitled to have uncommitted.  The paths are
# repository-relative, matching the snapshot keys, and the run is from rust/
# like everything above it.  Assigned first rather than piped, so a failure in
